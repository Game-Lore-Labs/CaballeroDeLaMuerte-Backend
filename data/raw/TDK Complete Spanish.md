# THE DEATH KNIGHT’S SQUIRE: A DM-LESS ADVENTURE!

## INTRODUCTION
This is a different kind of module. It is a solo adventure, designed for use with the Fifth Edition Dungeons and Dragons rules. It is designed for a player who cannot find a group with a dungeon master, but is dying to play D&D nonetheless.

Given the current resurgence of the game, there are quite a few of these players around, who due to geography or just poor luck are unable to indulge their newfound passion. This game is written for them, and for those who would like a little adventure in between their regular sessions with a dungeon master. And it is also written for those poor DMs (like myself) who never get a chance to play a PC.

A handful of solo adventures were released for the first and second editions of the game, such as Lathan’s Gold, Rage of the Rakasta, Ghost of Lion Castle and a few others of varying quality. The original red basic box set also included a solo adventure which I – and I’m sure many others – have fond memories of playing through.

However, I personally have not seen many solo adventures for 5e, apart from a few floating about online. Time to do something about that!

This adventure is set in the Forgotten Realms, but could easily be adapted to any world.

If you do not have access to the Dungeons & Dragons books like the Players Handbook, there is a handy PDF that Wizards of the Coast have kindly put out. It covers all the basic rules and can be found at this web address:
[http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basi-crules](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basi-crules)

## TILEPAGES
Important note: Don’t look at the maps until you are specifically directed to! You will only be spoiling the surprise and gameplay for yourself.

This adventure is played using two booklets:
- The Adventure Booklet, which contains named entries that form the narrative basis of the adventure.
- The Maps Booklet, which contains gridded sections of the adventure map, called tilepages, played through one-by-one with PC and monster tokens.

You will need to print the Maps Booklet, preferably in colour, for the optimal tabletop experience. You may want to print out the Adventure Booklet (this one) as well, or you could access it from your laptop or tablet.
(NOTE: When you access the PDF Adventure Booklet on a device, you will have access to the active links, removing the need to search through pages for the next entry).
If you don’t have access to a printer, jpg files of the individual maps have been included for your convenience. You can drop these straight into an application such as Roll20, placing and moving PC and monster tokens digitally.
If you are a DM and want to run this as an adventure with multiple PCs, contact me through DM’s Guild (leave a comment on on this product’s page) and I will supply you with the complete map.

As stated above, the Maps Booklet contains sections of the adventure map, called tilepages, revealed as you move through the adventure. Also, at the back of this booklet there are tilepage entries detailing actions you can take while on that tile page. When directed, you move a token onto the tilepage (Maps Booklet), then follow directions given in the tilepage entry.

You may find the maps useful for play, or you may not, but they do provide a handy visual reference for the adventure, as well as allowing you to keep track of your place. With the maps it is easier to find your place again if you lose track of what entry you’re on.

**NOTE:** As a rule, when you are reading entries in the Adventure Booklet, try to avoid looking at other entries as much as possible.

### TOKENS
Find something to function as PC and monster tokens: game tokens, coins, dice, anything with a bit of weight. In an ideal world, you’ll have miniatures. Use them if you have them!

### STANDARD ACTIONS
On a tilepage, you can move, search for traps, investigate, heal (you don’t need to wait to be directed to do this, if you have the ability), or any other number of options given. Instructions on the tilepage will direct you to certain entries in the Adventure Booklet (eg: “Go to entry CHECKTRAPS”), and from there you may be directed to further entries. Eventually you will be directed back to the tilepage, and from there onto connecting maps. Don’t worry too much about learning all that now – it will quickly become clear once you start playing!

### MOVEMENT
Standard rules regarding movement only apply to combat in this adventure. During combat you can move according to your speed for tactical advantage. Otherwise, follow directions given on the tilepages. Each square on the tilepage grid measures 5 ft. As far as monster movement is concerned, you will have to move monster tokens. Unless otherwise stated, all enemies will come at you via the shortest route and attack!

### MOVING BETWEEN MAPS
At the edge of each tilepage are numbers and arrows, which indicate what tilepages connect to the one you’re on. When you reach the edge of a tilepage, you can move onto the next map as indicated. In this way, you move through the adventure.

### D100 CHANCE ROLLS
Occasionally you will be directed to make a d100 roll, a chance roll. It is titled thus because there is a chance nothing will happen. However, if something does happen, it will not simply be some random encounter from a table. The encounter will be pertinent to the adventure, entwined in the plot and may also provide you with clues and / or items that could help you later in the adventure. I’m using this system as it leaves things nice and open, and provides a good level of variety.

### GREEN DOTS AND OTHER ITEMS ON THE PAGE
Occasionally you will see an item on a page, like an archway or a house or a pile or rocks, and you may move to investigate those. Instructions will be given on that tilepage as to how to do that. At other times, you may see a translucent green dot on the page at the intersections of tiles. Sometimes these will contain encounters (good and bad), at other times they will not! So you will never know whether to avoid the adjoining squares or go through them. Avoiding them might mean you run the chance of missing out on vital clues or items… Or it could mean you’ll avoid the mind flayer lurking just out of sight! Or, it might mean nothing - the dots will sometimes signify nothing at all. They are placed there to add an element of the unknown to the game.

### COMBAT
Run combat as it would be run in a normal game, but you play the part of both DM and player. You will need to roll dice, saving throws and all other appropriate rolls for yourself AND any monsters. When monster special attacks come into play, this will be included in the narrated text. Sometimes you will be asked to roll a die and spawn the monsters that many spaces from you. If you cannot move them that many spaces due to the grid spaces available, then just move them as far as you can, as far as the edge of the map you are on.

**Death saves (house rule):** There are no death saves in this adventure, unfortunately. If you are playing with a friend (you should double monster numbers if you are doing this) then death saves are allowed, as that extra character can cover you while you’re down. If you die (which is a possibility), you’ll just have to roll up another PC and try again!

### SPELLCASTING
I have given options throughout the adventure for casting spells (eg: “Do you know the spell Detect Magic? You could use this to see whether this weapon is enchanted or not. Go to entry DETECTSWORD”). So if you’re playing a mage, think about what spells could be useful in a solo adventure. Usually however, spellcasting will mainly be used in combat (Sacred Flame, Magic Missile etc), and you will choose when to employ it, without waiting to be prompted by the text entry. So, feel free to cast spells even if the text does not call for it. Use common sense. For example, if you want to cast Feather Fall to prevent fall damage, but the option is not given, still go ahead and cast it, avoiding the damage. Even if the options are not given, if you think the spell is appropriate for the situation and all the conditions are met, then go with it. Ask the question “What would a DM do?” Also, keep track of your spell slots.

### RESTING AND HEALING
Opportunities will be given to rest on certain tilepages. Follow normal rules for resting and recovering hd.

If you have healing abilities (Lay hands, Goodberry, Cure wounds etc etc) use those when you like and as appropriate, following normal 5e rules.

### SKILLS
Skill checks will be asked for when appropriate.

### DARKVISION
If you are playing a character without darkvision, then you will need torches. Lets say you buy these in Orlbar, your first port of call. However, when you are in combat situations in dark places, you will not be able to wield a two-handed weapon or a shield and a weapon simultaneously, and you will not be able to use two-handed fighting, unless that space is illuminated in some way. Outside there will always be a small amount of light. So, when you are entering dark spaces, it is presumed you are always kindling a torch (otherwise entering and encountering scenarios is basically impossible). This rule is circumvented if you happen to find some aid to vision within the adventure.

### ADVANTAGE
Be honest with yourself when awarding advantage to yourself or your opponents.
Example: If you are a ranger with a favoured terrain of forest and you roll for stealth while in a forest, you can award yourself advantage.
Or, if you are making an attack roll for an orc who has trapped you in a net, then roll for the orc with advantage.

Ask yourself, “What would a DM do?”

### HONESTY AND FAIRNESS
In order to give yourself a great, challenging game, the author assumes that you will play honestly and fairly. This means letting the dice fall where they may, keeping track of spell slots, etc etc, running monsters true to form. You’re really only cheating yourself if you don’t!

### CHECKING FOR TRAPS
If you fail a trap check, obviously you may not try again on that tilepage. Your PC does not know you didn’t make the roll! Move on with the rest of the tilepage instructions.

### REVISITING TILEPAGES
If you are returning to a tilepage, use common sense. If you have already checked for traps, or have already triggered a trap, you won’t fall for it again will you?
Your d100 chance roll is changed as well. In order to even make a d100 chance roll on a tilepage you are returning to, you must roll a D6.
1-5 means your previous passage has been noticed and creatures have moved to other parts of the forest now, and any items there have already been picked up. If you roll a 6, then you may make go to the d100 chance roll page (usually contained in the paragraph that starts with “When you are ready….”).

### OTHER ISSUES
Any other issues where you are not sure of the judgement or how you should play it, just exercise common sense and ask yourself….

## WHAT WOULD A DM DO?
This should be your guide when in doubt.

---

## JOURNAL & MAPPING
A good idea is noting down clues and information that you think might come in handy later on. And they are there – clues and important bits of information are peppered throughout the adventure, so the more you are paying attention, the higher the chance you will succeed in this mission! You could also map your progress using graph paper, which will add to your chances of success. (1 grid square = 5 ft)

## MULTIPLAYER AND DM PLAY
This adventure could easily be played by two characters, without a DM. One player would read the entries, and you simply double the amount of monsters in each encounter. A DM could also run this campaign by reading the entries to the players and running the combat and all monsters.

## CLASS FEATS AND ABILITIES
Obviously in D&D, classes have special abilities: a cleric’s Turn Undead ability, a paladin’s Divine Sense and so on. Where possible, I have tried to work these into the story, and you should feel free to bring these into combat and other situations, when called for. If there’s undead nearby, the text might read “Are you a paladin? If so, go to entry PALADINCAVE” and then inform you there that your Divine Sense is activated. I have also included many options for spellcasting. For example, I might say “Do you know the spell Prestidigitation? If so, you can cast it by going to entry ILLUSION”. So when creating your cleric, sorcerer, druid or any mage, give some thought as to what spells might be useful!

## CHARACTER CREATION
Please create a Level 2 character, equipping them with gear according to class. In addition to that, let’s say they’ve already completed one quest and received 150 gp to spend on whatever they want, which they did straight after that quest (consult Player’s Handbook p.145-150, standard D&D armour, weapons and equipment lists). For ability scores, choose between rolling and point-buy. I personally prefer point buy as it gives a little more control, but I’m leaving that call up to you. During playtesting, some players found that they completed the quest successfully on the first run! Others took two or three attempts to complete it. It is definitely replayable, but by no means designed to be an easy quest, so feel free to replay it as many times as you want, using different PCs and taking different routes. I’m envisioning this series being sequential, and going for a while, so your story will be formed within these adventures, but please do come up with a compelling backstory and background for your character as well, just because its fun, and helps you to enjoy the adventure. At the end of this, you will progress to level 3 (if you survive), ready for the next solo adventure, which I’m already in the process of writing. I’m not going to put restrictions on race or class – go with whatever you’re feeling, but keep in mind that this adventure is designed to be balanced with PHB4 characters. In other words, use the Players Handbook and, if you like, one other source to create your PCs. That one other source can be either Volo’s Guide to Monsters, Elemental Evil, or Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, but not Unearthed Arcana. If you’re new to D&D just stick with creating a character using the Player’s Handbook, as that already contains numerous options for character creation.

With all that out of the way, let’s get into the adventure!

# BACKSTORY
## Arrival in Orlbar
It is the year 1349 DR, in the month of Deepwinter. You have been on the road for nearly two months now, and snow hangs thick on the trees as you make your way towards the town of Orlbar, at the foot of the Greypeak Mountains. The Greypeaks are known throughout Faerun for their silver and iron mines, but it is a different type of metal that brought you here: gold. While you were in Neverwinter you overheard rumours of a large horde of treasure within an abandoned goblin keep. Even tavern rumours prove to be fruitful sometimes, and having been without a purpose for some months, you departed immediately for the Grey Vale. When you reach Orlbar, the air is brisk and town is busy. Carts carry all manner of goods: timber, wool bales, grain, and animals from the surrounding country. Some of these goods would be bound for Waterdeep or Neverwinter, others for the nearby city of Loudwater. Hungry and thirsty after many days on the road, you enter the first tavern you see, *The Woodsman’s Retreat*, and satisfy your cravings. Bread, cheese and a hot mulled wine do the trick nicely. You then enquire from the barkeep about accomodation. Your bones ache and rest is essential. The mountains can wait one or two days while you rest and replenish your supplies in town. The barkeep tells you that a very respectable inn, the Silver Flask, is just nearby. Toting your backpack, you walk down the street to the Silver Flask and pay for a room. The inkeep is a jolly woman who is glad to have your business, and she lights a cosy fire in your room. You bathe, then lie down to rest and soon fall into a deep sleep; it’s been a while since your travel-hardened self has had clean sheets and a roof overhead!

You are woken later that night by noise from the next room. You can hear a woman openly sobbing on the other side of the wall. The sound is gut-wrenching. Every now and then a male voice says something, as if trying to comfort her. You tolerate this for a while, but eventually it becomes evident that sleep is going to be impossible, and you walk out into the hallway and knock on the door to the room next to yours.
An elderly man answers. He is dressed finely, like a member of the aristocracy, but sports a nasty black eye and a gash across his cheek. In the background a woman, also richly dressed, sits on a chair by the fire, her face buried in her hands.
“Yes? What is it?” the elderly gentleman asks directly.
You straighten yourself up, peering into the room.
“I was wondering what all the noise was about,” you say, although now you don’t feel quite so annoyed. “I could hear the crying from next door. I was wondering,” you say gruffly, not used to dealing with aristocrats, “If it’s anything I can help you with? Perhaps then we can all get some rest?”
At this the woman looks up and sees you. You probably look a fright, after all those weeks on the road – ungroomed, hair dishevelled, travel-worn clothes - but you’ve had a bath so you at least you don’t smell bad. However, your type has an… air about them. You’ve seen a fight or two and know how to handle yourself in most situations. You’re what’s known in these parts as ‘the adventuring type.’ Such types generally know how to get things done, things that others might shy away from.
“Show our guest in, Elric,” the woman says weakly, drying her tears with a silk handkerchief.

## THE MYSTERIOUS KNIGHT
You are shown to a chair. For some reason, this old couple, who introduce themselves as Lord and Lady Brewmont, welcome your presence, if only as a distraction from the grief they seem consumed by.
“We arrived here last night,” Lady Brewmont begins. “Elric is so busy these days, so we thought we would bring ourselves out to Orlbar for a little holiday. Our son, he’s so fond of the mountains. Loves all the stories. Well, he’s our grandson really. The son of our daughter who died some years ago. He is all we have left of her. We call him our son.” Lady Brewmont begins sobbing once more.
Elric Brewmont picks up the thread. “Long story short, my friend, we were accosted on the highway. We were passing along a lonely stretch of road when he appeared, from nowhere. A knight, a towering brute of a man, all clad in armour.” Lord Elric points to his face. “Did this to me, knocked me out cold. Then he grabbed our boy, threw him on a horse and bolted! Without a word!”
“Hmm,” you say, mulling over this information. “Did he seem familiar, this knight?”
Elric shakes his head. “I know what you’re thinking. Wealthy aristocrat, on holiday from Loudwater, someone must have known we were coming out here, and seized the opportunity. It’s true, I am what you would call… a public figure. It is well known, in Loudwater at least, that I am a wealthy man. But no… this knight was something else. We didn’t see his face, it was hidden by a great metal visor. A towering warrior he was, a hulk of a man.”

Lady Brewmont speaks again. “And he has kidnapped our poor little Darek! Abducted him, just ripped him out of our grasp!”

## INCOMPETENT FOOLS
“What did you do then?” you ask.
“We came straight to Orlbar,” Lady Brewmont says. “We went to the Captain of the Guard, but he, he…”
“A thoroughly incompetent fool,” Lord Brewmont growls. “Said this Knight was a ghost, that he’d chosen Darek as his squire, and that there was nothing we could do about it! Said Darek wasn’t the first. Called him The Death Knight! You can imagine what a comfort that was to us.”
“They say the Knight lives in the wood nearby,” Lady Brewmont says airily, as if in a waking dream. “Weathercote Wood, isn’t it dear?”
The old man grits his teeth, staring into the fire, and punches his palm. “Ghost my arse!” he snarls through gritted teeth. “That knight looked real enough to me. He’s a lunatic, nothing more, a lunatic who kidnaps young boys! And when I find the blaggard, by the Gods will he pay!”
You can’t help thinking that Lord Brewmont is a bit out of his depth here. You don’t doubt his resolve, but he looks as though his days of conquest are well behind him.

You feel for this poor old couple. While not usually associating with the wealthy, you do know that you have something to offer them, and you’re never one to shy away from a good adventure… especially when the chance of a reward is on the table.
“I can find your boy,” you hear yourself saying.
The woman looks up, and new hope begins to shine from her eyes.
“Oh Gods,” she says, her voice quavering. “We’ll give you anything, anything…”
The old man is a little more practical. “If I was a few decades younger, I’d be out there myself. I saw action in the Battle of Tanglefork, when we freed the Vale from Rensha rule.”
You nod appreciatively – that battle happened about 30 years ago, and was said to be fierce. You are not surprised – Elric Brewmont definitely carries himself like an old veteran.
“I can’t put my sword forward any more, but I can offer you gold, my friend… 2000 pieces of it, to be exact…”

# ENTRIES
THE ADVENTURE BEGINS...

## ADVENTUREBEGINS
At dawn the next day, following the few scraps of information you have, you saddle your horse and ride to the outskirts of town. The townsfolk pay you little mind as you go, casting you the occasional glance.
The journey to Weathercote Wood lies due east, but is no short ride. The Captain of the Guard tells you that the Death Knight has always been seen in a small patch of wood that juts out from the western side of Weathercote, “like a wart on a giant’s nose.”
By midday you reach a sign which tells you you have another 15 miles to go. You should make it there by nightfall.
Not far past the sign is a small inn and tavern. An old man sits on a chair in the afternoon sun, and raises a tankard of ale as you pass.

“Last drink for many miles!” the old man calls to you. “Come, sit! I’ll buy you an ale!”
*(Hint: Hover over the choices and click to navigate to your selection).*

- *Do you accept the old man’s invitation? If so, go to entry BREWSKI.*
- *If you are mindful of the time and choose to ride on, go to entry KEEPGOING.*

## ALLCLEAR?
You search around the door but find nothing trap-like.

- *To try and open the door, go to entry OPENSTONEDOOR*
- *To leave and continue north, go back to Tilepage 3 and continue from the last line you read.*

## AMBUSH?
Suddenly something gives way under your feet. You fall about 10 ft, landing heavily in a deep pit. It winds you, and you get to your feet shakily, cursing your carelessness.
*Take Id6 fall damage*
Looking around, you decide that you had better get out of this pit trap as quickly as possible, before whoever dug it returns!

- *Do you have rope? If so, go to entry ROPEESCAPE*
- *Do you know the spell Jump? If so, go to JUMPESCAPE*
- *Are you a variant tiefling (Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide) or do you have some other way of flying? Go to entry FLYESCAPE*
- *Otherwise you could try carving steps into the dirt walls with your weapon. Go to entry DIGESCAPE*

## APOLOGIZE
The strange man waves a hand dismissively.
“Your apologies mean little to me. Be on your way.”
*Do you want to respond or not?*

- *“You are very rude, my friend. No wonder you’re out here all alone talking to fairies.” Go to CHASTISE*
- *Shaking your head confusedly, you turn and depart, leaving this demented soul to his own devices. Return to tilepage 9 and continue from the last direction you read*

## ASYOUWERE
You keep watching, peering into the forest, but don’t see any other movement.
Shrugging, you turn your attention back to the path and the quest at hand.

- *Return to tilepage 5 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## AWAKE
You wake up in the cabin, and find that you are once more able to move! It is totally dark inside the cabin… probably night time. You look around, but the cultists are gone.

- *Go to entry INDUCTED*

## BACKTOJUNCTION
As you are heading south back towards the four-way junction, you hear a crack of thunder overhead, followed by a hollow, ragged laugh, coming from the direction of the cemetery. A sense of urgency overcomes you… you sense, in the pit of your stomach, that time is running out for Darek Brewmont.

- *To ignore your instincts and head south anyway, go to IGNOREINSTINCTS*
- *To return to the cemetery, go to tilepage 10 and follow the directions there (ignoring anything you have already encountered or investigated)*

## BADLIAR
The thief shakes his head, pouting angrily at you.
“I don’t believe this story,” he says firmly.
“You are lying to me. For that, I have a mind to cast you out and keep everything you carry…. hmmm.”
He eyes you up and down, considering.
“Instead,” he says finally, “I will take one thing of value from you. What do you carry? I don’t want your weapon but… something else. Show me what you carry. And don’t bother telling me the real story now. I don’t want to hear it. You had a chance to tell the truth, and you chose to lie instead. I want something from you, in return for letting you go. For daring to enter our lair and rifle through our possessions!”
The female stands nearby, caressing the flat of her blade and eyeing you darkly. The boy stands motionless, watching you with head tilted slightly back and hands clasped before him. You are severely outnumbered here.
You must choose one item worth at least 20gp from your inventory (gold or gems will also do) and give it to this hardened rogue.
Only then will you be allowed to go free. As soon as you have done this, you are quite literally shown the door. Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read.

## BALLSYMOVE
There is a long, awkward silence, and you fear the worst. Then the Blood Knight throws his head back and laughs uproariously, the sound filling the room and nearly deafening you. You wince, covering your ears. Finally he stops, and addresses you, leveling his greatsword under your chin.
Suddenly you feel paralyzed, as if by a spell.
“You are very brave, traveller. You will make a perfect general for the Goddess. Now BOW, or DIE LIKE A DOG!”

- *Do you bow to the Blood Knight’s will? If so, go to DARKQUEST*
- *If you still resist, go to entry RESIST*

## BATEDBREATH
You give it a reasonable look over, but decide that the entrance is not booby-trapped.
Gingerly, you ease the gates open. The metal seems to be relatively rust-free and does not creak as you expected it would. Easing yourself within the gates, you grasp the handle of the left stone door and lean back. It swings smoothly out.

- *Do you know the spell Detect Evil and Good? You can cast this by going to entry DETECTEVIL*
- *Alternately, you can simply proceed inside. Go to entry CROSSTHRESHOLD*

## BEARINGS
Your primal instinct, your danger sense, is clamouring, warning you that danger is close at hand. You don’t know the nature of that danger, but experience tells you that it’s likely a strong enemy is nearby.
It is as if the air itself has been sucked out of this place. The crypt sits silent and pale as bone on the far side, shaded by the trees which border this graveyard.

## BENDINGPASSAGE
As quietly as you can, you sidle around the corner… a diagonal passage continues ahead and opens into a room, which appears to be illuminated.
You hear the voice again, little more than a growl shaped into words: “Look at me, curl Look at me!”
You take advantage of these words to make a few more steps, and then you have a view into the room. What you see stops your heart.
Seated on a large throne atop a dais is a gruesome-looking warrior. Even sitting down he appears tall; you reckon his height to be at least seven feet, probably taller. He is armoured from head to toe, although his face and parts of his midriff are exposed. The armour is patched and rusted. In his hand he holds a huge sword, and he is glaring at the bound figure grovelling before him. This figure has their back to you, but you notice the clothes of a noble. From his size, you judge this to be a teenage boy; likely Darek Brewmont. Which can only mean one thing: the big ugly guy on the throne is the Death Knight! And it looks as though you have arrived just in time – this appears to be a Squiring ceremony!
You feel a malevolent energy pulsing from the warrior. Watching, your mind races as you carefully consider your next move.
Oddly, to his right is a brazier which emanates an unearthly blue light, casting an eerie pall over the huge warrior.
Place a token to represent the Death Knight on the throne, and one representing you near the door. Don’t worry about a token for Darek just yet.
Did you succeed on that earlier stealth check?
- *If so, go to entry SNEAKUP*
- *If not, go to entry WELCOME*

## BENDTRAPS
As you enter the passage, you check thoroughly for traps ahead.
Make a perception roll, DC 14. If you have a hand-drawn map that you picked up in your travels, you may make this roll with advantage.
- *If you are successful, go to entry PASSAGETRAPS*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to entry ITLLBEFINE*
- *If you prefer not to try, go to entry DOGLEG*

## BENDYBIT
Roll perception, DC 10.
- *If you succeed, go to WHATTRAPS?*
- *If you fail, go to TRAPSWHAT*

## BETTER
Searching around the nooks and crannies, you find a few trinkets, items of worship and other things, mostly worthless.
Then you come across a pile of books, stacked against the wall. Rummaging quickly through them, you find a scroll, a little bit flattened, but then, unrolling it you see eldritch runes meticulously written in red ink. At the bottom, in small writing, you see the following words printed in a neat hand:

A Scroll of Curing Wounds, gifted by the gracious cleric Kagnar the Indefatigable. All glory to Amaunator
What a find! You stow the scroll in your backpack, feeling much better about how things are turning out! This is bound to come in handy.
(Add a Spell scroll, Cure wounds, 1st Level, to your inventory. This scroll, when used, will restore 1d8+2 hp to the user).
- *To investigate the image of Amaunator, go to entry INSPECTALTAR*
- *If you have already inspected the altar, you become mindful that time is pressing, and you leave this underground chamber. Go to entry LEAVECHAMBER*

## BETTERSAFE
You hold your breath, waiting till the kobold patrol has passed, and then re-emerge on the path, and look north. What else lurks in this forest? Taking a breath, you continue on.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## BEYONDRIVER
You give the walls and floor a pretty good search, but find no traps.
You continue down the tunnel.
- *Go to entry MOVEWITHIN*

## BITEME
You move your hand away just in time, avoiding the bite of whatever it was that attacked you. And then you see what it was: a GIANT CENTIPEDE emerges from the shadows, skittering towards you on a multitude of legs!

## BLADEBOY
Darek has managed to cut himself free and has gotten to his feet. He is shaky, but there is a light in his eyes. You remember Lord Brewmont, and how honourable he seemed... perhaps there is a little bit of the warrior in this boy too!
Roll initiative for Darek (straight d20) and have him enter the fray with whatever weapon he is holding. Stats for Darek are below. Place his token at the wall of the chamber.

### ATTACKS
Use the stats for whichever blade you have supplied him with, no modifiers. Straight d20 to attack.

The Death Knight will not attack Darek until you are dead, so stay alive!
- *Go to entry YOURATTACK*

## BLADEDODGE
Scything blades come swinging out of the walls towards you, but you manage to jump out of the way just in time. You feel the air from the razor-sharp edge as they swing, back and forward, like dual pendulums. Heart pounding, you stand and proceed towards the circular room which is now visible ahead.
- *Go to entry CIRCULARROOM*

## BLADEPOINT
You are ushered at bladepoint back into the abandoned mine, then kicked in the back of the leg and forced to the ground. This is when you get your first good look at the blade wielder: an older man, he appears to be the leader. He carries a needle-thin rapier in one hand and a dagger, backhanded, in the other. You know this fighting style. These are rogues. Thieves. And, obviously, the residents of this den.
The woman stands behind you, with weapon drawn. Sighing resignedly, as if this thing happens often, the older man finds a chair and plonks down in it. Suddenly the boy reappears and informs the leader of what you had been up to in their treasure room. You are searched, and any items you took are retrieved. Then you are bound hand and foot, and given a boot in the stomach for good measure.
“So,” the man says finally. “Give me a good reason why we shouldn’t kill you, intruder? What’s your story? What are you doing in Weathercote Wood, and more specifically, what are you doing in our lair? Who are you?” he demands.
- *Do you tell this thief of your quest? Go to DISCLOSURE*
- *Or will you make something up? Go to SPINYARN*

## BLESSING
The little fairy flutters towards you across the stream and lands on your shoulder. “What blessing would you like me to bestow?” Plumeria asks you. “Expertise or endurance?”
- *If you choose expertise, go to EXPERTISE*
- *If you choose endurance, go to ROBUSTNESS*

## BLOODKNIGHTSCURSE
Despite your victory, the words of the Blood Knight are still fresh in your mind. Turning north at the junction that led you to the cemetery, you continue for a short way, after which this part of Weathercote Wood finally ends, and the landscape changes to wide, open grassland, bordered on the east by the main part of the wood which stretches north.
The sky is overcast, threatening rain, and pulling poor Darek behind you, you proceed at a run to a nearby farmhouse where you steal a horse. The farmer comes out of his house as you gallop away, shouting and waving his fist at your back.
You reach Orlbar that evening, and deliver Darek to his grateful grandparents.
“You shall be rewarded, brave champion,” Lord Brewmont promises, his eyes misting over. “On the morrow, I shall go to the Orlbar bank, and –“
You cut Lord Brewmont off, informing him that there is no time. You want to be out of this town as soon as possible. Now the Blood Knight has physical form, he will pursue you to the ends of the realm, and possibly beyond, with his army of cultists. You certainly don’t want those fanatics following you to the village of Orlbar. That will put all these poor folk in danger.
Lord Brewmont is sad that he is not able to reward you properly. But then Lady Brewmont comes forth, clasping your hands gratefully.
“Thank you,” she says, and then reaches up and unclasps her necklace, removing it from her neck and placing it in your hands. “Sell this,” she says. “And don’t take anything less than 700 gold for it!”
Seeing your urgency, Lord Brewmont gifts you with a horse from his carriage team, and you mount up and ride immediately, out of Orlbar and into the deep, inky night.

- *Go to entry SPOILSOFADVENTURE*

## BREWSKI
You tie your horse up to the tavern’s porch and join the old man, who directs a young boy to bring you a frothing tankard of ale. The boy also brings a bowl of stew for you to eat.
“What brings you out this way?” the old man asks eventually.

- *Do you tell him of your quest? If so, go to entry QUESTCONVO.*
- *If you choose to simply replenish yourself and be on your way, go to entry REPLENISH.*

## BRINGIT
You bravely stand your ground, and place a hand on your weapon, fixing the new arrivals with a steely gaze.
You can soon make out what they are: Kobolds! They see you and shout, then move quickly forward.
In their broken Common, the one who appears to be the leader addresses you.
“Pay up, human! 5 gold to pass this way. All must pay the toll.”

- *Do you pay the gold? If so, go to entry PAYTOLL*
- *If not, go to entry TOLLBEDAMNED*

## BUMPINTHENIGHT
Roll a d100
- *If you roll 0-33 go to entry MIDNIGHTSNACK*
- *If you roll 34-66 go to entry DISTURBED*
- *If you roll 67-100 go to entry NIGHTNIGHT*

## BURNWEB
You unleash the fire on the webs, and the silky strands quickly ignite. As flame consumes the webs, you hear a horrid screeching and a clacking sound...
From the side of the path where they were hidden, awaiting their prey, two GIANT WOLF SPIDERS emerge and advance quickly on you!
- *Go to entry SPIDERBATTLE*

## CABINENTRY
You cautiously edge inside the cabin, looking around. It appears empty, even though a crackling fire burns in the hearth. There is a strange smell in here...
Suddenly you feel something press against your skull, as if a giant invisible hand were crushing it! You resist as best you can, but the force is overwhelming. Within moments, you have blacked out.
You wake at what seems like many hours later. It is dark inside the room, probably night-time, and the room is empty.
- *Go to entry INDUCTED*

## CAMPNORTHWEST
To the northwest is a low rock outcropping beneath the trees. You unfurl your bedroll beneath it.
If you are eating provisions, do so now.
You lie down and quickly fall asleep to the gentle sound of wind whispering through the canopy.
- *Go to entry BUMPINTHENIGHT*

## CAPTIVE
The Cultist waits there, watching you for some time, as you plot the different ways you could possibly get out of this situation.
Soon more of her kind arrive, burly male cultists, and five descend into the pit.
Realizing you are outnumbered, you submit to being tied up and blindfolded and are soon tossed into a cart which begins trundling along the path. The female cultist kicks you occasionally, laughing each time she does so.
The journey is relatively short, and you can still hear the birds and rustling of the trees, so you know you are still within the wood.
You try to keep track of the twists and turns, but lying in the bottom of the cart blindfolded, you become disoriented. Then you feel your sleeve being pulled up and something being rubbed on your arm. A strong, antiseptic smell hits your nostrils and moments later you fall into a deep, unconscious state.
When you wake, much later, the blindfold has been removed, and someone has loosed the bonds on your wrists and feet. It is dark in the room, and you massage your extremities as you look around.
You appear to be in a cabin of some kind.
- *Go to entry INDUCTED*

## CAVECLUES
You have a scavenge around. There were people here at one time, lots of people. You find rings, semi-precious jewellery (to the value of 10gp, if you want to take it) and a few silver pieces here and there (17 in total). You also find, disturbingly, a child's wooden toy soldier... but nothing of any real value.
You may take a short rest here if you wish, regaining one hit die.
- *When you are done here, you may leave this cave. Go to entry LEAVECAVERN*

## CAVESTREAM
You peer into the black cave entrance that gaps at you from the other side of the river. The area around the entrance is interesting – it appears to be surrounded with discarded pottery and other detritus. Perhaps there was a settlement here once. Tribal societies once roamed this area freely in prehistory. Now the cave appears abandoned, and its black mouth forbidding.
The stream appears calm but a glance at its depths tells you it is moving quite swiftly. It might take a bit of effort to cross.
You may take this opportunity to refill your waterskin if need be.

- *Are you a paladin? If so, go to entry DEEPCURRENT*
- *To attempt to wade across the stream, make an athletics check, DC 12. If you succeed go to entry STREAMCROSSED. If you fail, go to entry SWEPTDOWN*
- *If you do not wish to attempt this, Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read.*

Place one token on the map to represent the centipede, roll initiative, then do battle with the hideous bug! Spawn its token within melee range.

## CHALLENGE
You brandish your weapon and stand your ground before the rider.
“Halt, brigand!” you roar as ferociously as you can. “Release that boy, or I’ll knock you off your mount, you merciless rogue!”
The rider pulls his horse to a stop, and then appears to tilt his head down towards you. With a single, smooth motion, he moves his gauntletted hand forward and lifts his visor. And what you see inside the visor is... nothing. Just an empty, black void.
Your heart stops, and it seems time stops too. Your hands go cold, and your mouth dries up.
Then, suddenly, the armoured rider throws his head back, and a hollow, horrifying laugh fills the forest around you, echoing off every tree, scattering a multitude of birds into the sky...
You close your eyes and clap your hands over your ears, as the malevolent cackle reaches down and smothers all good feelings within you... leaving only a despairing, black emptiness.
When you open your eyes again, the mounted figure is gone.
Gods, what did you just see? You breathe slowly, regaining your composure, slowing your heart, and praying to the gods you hold dear to give you strength! Looks like you’ll need it for this quest.

- *Return to tilepage 6 and continue from the last direction you read*

## CHANCEROLL
Make a d100 roll, adding 10 if you made a successful stealth check earlier.
- *If you score 0-33, go to DRYBONES*
- *If you score 34-65, go to PHANTASM*
- *If you score 66-100, go to QUIETPATH*

## CHARMTHEPANTS
“You should let me go,” you hear yourself saying. “Do you know of the Death Knight?”
The three all look at each other. “We do,” the leader says, looking back at you. “What of it?”
“I’m here to put an end to him,” you say. “And to rescue a boy he has kidnapped.”
There is an immediate change to their demeanour.
“The Death Knight’s Squire!” the female rogue hisses.
“What do you mean?” you ask quickly.
She shakes her head. “He has kidnapped this boy to turn him into his squire. We’ve seen it before.”
Your eyes go wide. “This has happened before?”
The head rogue nods. “Yes. Some years ago. And it didn’t end well.”
There is an awkward silence then, after which the leader directs the boy to search you.
He finds any items you might have taken. If you have the night goggles and a healing potion, the leader lets you keep these.
“Here,” he says, and comes forward, holding out a small bottle. “Holy water, given to me by a cleric. It may come in handy.” He gives you a slight smile. “Go well, traveller. I can’t let you steal from us, but if you can rid the wood of the Death Knight’s Scourge, you’ll be doing this land a great favour. We tried once before to infiltrate his lair. We failed. Now we do not concern ourselves with the business of ordinary folk.”
Except to rob them, you think, but say instead, “Thanks.”
The female rogue brings you something too – a hand-drawn map.
“We made this after we tried to enter his lair last time.”
You study the map – it is incomplete, but could prove useful.
You will find the map at the back of the Tilepage Booklet.

You farewell these rogues, and climb out of the entrance hole.
- *Return to tilepage entry 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## CHASTISE
At these words, the man rounds in anger, his face contorted in fury.
“Insolent fool!” he roars, thrusting his hands towards you. A strange, sickly grey beam of energy flies at you across the river!

Make a dexterity save, DC 12 (he’s quite far away).
- *If you fail, go to entry GREYBEAM*
- *If you succeed, go to entry LUCKYDODGE*

## CHECKSUCCESS
You search carefully around, but see nothing to indicate any traps are set here.
- *Return to tilepage 1 and continue from the last direction you read*

## CHESTTRAPS
Make a perception roll, DC 17.
- *If you are successful, go to CRAFTY*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to HMMM*

## CIRCULARROOM
This room is perfectly circular, and unlike the last one, does not smell musty. There is a faint smell of incense in here, and at the other side of the room from where you entered, you can see an altar of some kind. Rubble is scattered across the altar, and the floor at its base.
- *To investigate this rubble, go to entry LOOKRUBBLE*
- *To continue on towards the exit on the other side of the room, go to entry TUNNELVISION*

## CLAPPERS
You redouble your efforts, digging for all your life is worth!
- *Make an athletics check, DC 15. If you succeed, go to DIGGER*
- *If you fail, go to TOOSLOW*

## CLIMBOUT
Your lasso works a treat! It catches on the broken branch stump and you quickly tighten it. Testing the rope a couple of times, you brace your feet on the side of the pit and, hand over hand, walk yourself up and out. Quickly you gather up your rope, stow it in your pack and continue down the path, back on the trail of the Death Knight!
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read*

## CLIMBREDTREE
Make an athletics check, DC9.
- *If successful, go to TRECCLIMB*
- *If unsuccessful, go to OHDEAR*

## CLOAKCHECK
You make your way off the path slightly, primed for any movement, and walk slowly up to the cloak. Pulling it down off the branch, you turn it over in your hands, inspecting the workmanship. It looks like it belonged to someone about your size, and you place it over your shoulders to try it out. You feel a change come over you – instantly you feel more secure, more hidden even. You have a feeling this cloak could come in very handy.

Add a Cloak of Protection to your inventory. This cloak will give you +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you are wearing it! What a find!

Pleased with your new acquisition, you rejoin the path and continue on your way.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read*

## COASTCLEAR
You do a pretty thorough visual search of the area, but find no traps.
- *Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## COMEATME
You ready your ranged attack, waiting with bated breath to see who appears.
A hooded figure appears in sight.
_Make your attack! Their AC is 12!_
- *If you hit, take note of damage and go to CULTISTCOMBAT*
- *If you miss, go to entry ENRAGED*

## COMPLIMENT
The stranger's mood changes once more, a broad smile lighting up his face.
“Oh, you like them?” he says with feigned modesty. “Yes, I got them in Llorkh, some years ago now, but they’ve kept their shape well, haven’t they! Thank you for your kind words, traveller! Plumeria, go and give our new friend a blessing!”
You are beginning to see how capricious this stranger’s moods are. He seems quite literally away with the fairies.

How do you respond to this?
- *“A blessing? Why thank you, that sounds wonderful!” Go to entry BLESSING*
- *“No thank you, I must be on my way.” Go to entry DECLINE*

## CONVERSATION
The stranger seems friendly enough, and you respond, “You seem very relaxed! Do you live here in Weathercote Wood?”
“I do,” he says, a mysterious twinkle in his eyes. “For some years now. I talk to the trees, the birds, the woodland spirits… they are all my friends.”
As you near this enigmatic fellow, you notice several strange things about him. For one, his voice does not seem to match his frame. His voice is deep, commanding, and he appears quite a slight man, short enough to pass for a halfling even, if a slightly taller one.
There is a small winged creature who has alighted nearby, and strangely, the stranger has his feet rested on the head of what looks like a fallen stone statue.
This strikes you as strange. A statue, all the way out here?
Who is this mysterious character, and what is his story?
You consider your next words.
- *“What is that statue that you rest your feet on, friend?” Go to entry STATUEQUESTION*
- *“Do you know anything of the Death Knight?” Go to DKQUESTION*
- *“Who is your little winged friend?” Go to FAIRYQUESTION*

## CORPSE
You lose your balance and drop, but only a short distance. To your horror, however, you smell death, feel a clammy hand grab you around the chest, and a horrid croak rattle in your ears!
Roll a d20 and add 3.
- *If the result is is equal to or higher than your AC, go to SLAMMED*
- *If lower, go to EXTRICATE*

## CRAFTY
Cleverly concealed within the lock mechanism, you see a trigger switch that could be connected to a poison dart or something similar. The mechanism is extremely fine and will be hard to disarm. Still, no guts, no glory, right?
Do you want to try to disarm it? You will need thieves’ tools.
If you do, make a thieves’ tools check, DC 17. This is a dex check with your proficiency bonus if you are a rogue, added twice if you have expertise.
- *If you are successful, go to MASTERTHIEF*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to NOOBTHIEF*
- *If you would rather not, you can check the pile of books and scrolls for clues. Go to SEARCHCLUES*
- *Or you could leave the cave. Go to entry LEAVECAVE*

## CREEPERSLAIN
Add 50 XP
You finally lay waste to the undead creeper, but keep your weapon to hand as you turn, facing the crypt. You fancy that you just heard an echo of some sort, like just the faintest note of… a song? An incantation? It was too faint to tell.
You notice the dappled light of the sun, getting low in the sky once more. It only feels like an hour since morning! What is going on with the time in this wood?

The burden of your quest lays heavily on your mind, and you begin to feel a sense of urgency. Perhaps it is already too late to rescue Darek Brewmont! You hope not.
- *Are you a paladin? If so go to EXUDING*
- *If not, you move forward to investigate the entrance to the crypt. Go to entry ENTRANCETOMB*
- *If there is some other action you would like to take, for example to heal, (not rest, that would be foolish here), or leave the cemetery, you may return to the tilepage and take this action, moving your token appropriately.

## CRITICAL
Roll initiative (d20) for yourself and the Death Knight. His initiative bonus is -1.
- *If you win the initiative, go to INITWON*
- *If you do not, go to KNIGHTATTACK*

## CROSSTHRESHOLD
You move inside the door and into the cool silence of the crypt. A stone passage, well-paved with solid rock walls, extends ahead.
- *Move your token to sub-map 3 (in the tilepage booklet) and follow the directions given*

## CULTISTCOMBAT
Place one token on the map to represent the cultist, 30 feet away (six squares) if you are fighting within the pit, melee range if not. Roll initiative and deal to this crazed fanatic! Who knows what bizarre ritual you were destined for!
The cultist will fire her crossbow first until you are within melee range, then she will use her scimitar (unless you are still in the pit, in which case she will use her crossbow the entire time).

### CULTIST
Medium Human, Lawful Evil

**Armour Class** 12  
**Hit Points** 9  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 11 (0)  
**DEX** 12 (+1)  
**CON** 10 (0)  
**INT** 10 (0)  
**WIS** 11 (0)  
**CHA** 10 (0)

**Proficiency Bonus** +2  
**Senses** PP10  
**Skills** Religion +2, Deception +2  
**Languages** Common  
**CR** 1/8 (25 XP)

**Dark Devotion** The cultist has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened

### ATTACKS
**Hand crossbow** +3 to hit, 1d6 piercing damage  
**Scimitar** +2 to hit, 1d6 piercing damage

- *If you are victorious, go to EXCULTIST*
- *If you are victorious, but still within the pit, go to STILLSTUCK*
- *If you run out of ranged attacks, go to SPENT*
- *If you are defeated, go to OHWELL*

## CULTISTSHUT
You duck inside the still-open door of the little hut the cultists emerged from. The room appears to be empty! Suddenly you feel something press against your skull, as if a giant invisible hand were crushing it! You resist as best you can, but the force is overwhelming. Within moments, you have blacked out.
You wake at what seems like much, much later. It is dark inside the room, probably night-time, and the room is empty.
- *Go to entry INDUCTED*

## DARKQUEST
At these words, you hear a crackling sound, like logs moving in a fire, and through the Blood Knight’s visor, you see the twisted shape of a hideous smile made out in embers, like a thin line of fire. You stare in horror. “Excellent, mortal! You have pleased me well. I would complete this task myself, but until the Goddess’s arrival I cannot risk standing in sunlight. As soon as Kiaranaslee comes, she will grant me physical form. Then, for a time, I may roam free. Now go, fulfill your destiny!!”
*(If you were frozen by a spell, you are now released from this)*. You stand, and, as if in trance, walk from the cabin. There, in a small pile outside the door, are your belongings. You quickly check them: yes everything is there, including your provisions. You shoulder your backpack, regaining some small measure of comfort, and look around, getting your bearings. You wonder for a second if this was all a dream, but then you feel for your newly acquired sword… and yes, it is still there. Quickly you turn, open the door, and peer inside again… but the hut is now empty. The Blood Knight is gone, and the table and chairs are overturned and covered in cobwebs and dust. What?! What just happened?
*Add Sword of the Goddess’s Wrath to your inventory. Against normal creatures, this functions as a longsword with an extra Id4 of fire damage, but against undead creatures, it gives you a +2 bonus on all attack rolls, with a damage of Id8 slashing and Id4 fire. Note these stats on your inventory.*

- *You are standing on a pathway through Weathercote Wood. Go to tilepage 6 and continue from the last direction you read, or start with the first entry if this is your first time on this tilepage.*

## DARTHIT
Two darts shoot out of cleverly concealed holes on the surrounding frame of the stone door, straight at you! You recoil in pain as they pierce your skin.
Roll 2d4 and deduct the result from your HP.
As you quickly tend to your wound, you look inside the now open door. Beyond it is a dark passageway, and some way inside you can see that a set of stairs leads down.
- *If you wish to enter, go to ENTERPASSAGE, or return to tilepage 3 if you want to leave this place and continue north or east.*

## DARTMISS
The darts fly out at you at blinding speed, but your reflexes kick in and you dodge quickly out of the way. Well done!
- *Go to ENTERPASSAGE, or Return to tilepage 3 if you want to leave this place and continue north or east.*

## DEADEND
You tread warily through the gravestones, weaving between them and taking care not to disturb whatever sleeps beneath your feet. You are about 100 ft away from the crypt.
- *Go to ENTRANCETOMB*

## DEADGOBLINS
Add 150 XP
You quickly search the goblin’s bodies. Apart from their weapons, they carry little of value; they appear to be tribal, not really caring much for money or anything much else, apart from murdering passers-by perhaps! However, the leader of the group carries something interesting on a chain around his neck. It appears to be a human-sized ring.

You can feel something emanating from it, some kind of potency. What is this little trinket?
- *Do you know the Identify spell? That would tell you what this trinket is. If you want to cast Identify, go to DETECTRING*
- *If not, you could try putting it on? Go to entry PUTRINGON*

## DEADLIZARDS
Add 75 XP
You slay all three kobolds and quickly sheathe your weapon, feeling a sudden sense of urgency. A brief search of their bodies reveals two daggers, and a pouch containing… your jaw drops. Around 120gpl These kobolds have been busy little blighters, it seems!
Satisfied with your find, you stand and look north, wondering what other surprises lay on the path ahead.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## DEADNELLY
You walk forward to where the beast had been before, making all that noise that woke you. There, twitching in its death throes, is the horse you rode from Orlbar. Gritting your teeth in anger, you take out your weapon and quickly put the poor beast out of its misery.
The first rays of dawn begin to creep into the sky. With a sigh of resignation, you wipe the horse’s blood from your weapon and begin the trek towards the wood’s edge.
The morning is peaceful, in contrast to the savagery you have just witnessed, and a chorus of birds greet the dawn with calls that echo off the low hills of the surrounding landscape. As you near Weathercote Wood and can see down the single path that leads into its depths, you see that little light seems to penetrate in through the canopy. Night still hides beneath the mossy boughs and dark green vines that thread the ancient trees together.
You step onto the path and enter Weathercote Wood… who knows what fate awaits you within these shadowed depths…
- *Go to tilepage 1 (Maps Booklet) and then click this link to go to the entry.*

## DEADSPIDERS
Add 100 XP
You take a moment to catch your breath, recovering from the battle with the spiders. Their dismembered corpses litter the ground.
You destroy the rest of the webs, and then assess the situation.
- *To have a look around, go to entry INVESTIGATESPIDERS.*
- *To keep going, go back to Tilepage 2 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## DEATHBED
To your horror, you feel the ground begin to give way beneath your feet!
Make a dexterity check, DC 16.
- *If successful, go to JUMPAWAY*
- *If unsuccessful, go to CORPSE*

## DEATHLYPACT
Do you have a pact with the Blood Knight of Kiaransalee?
- *If so, go to entry BLOODKNIGHTSCURSE*
- *If not, go to entry ULTIMATEGLORY*

## DECLINE
“No, that’s all right thanks,” you reply.
The man stands, screwing up his face. “You would refuse a blessing from an innocent little sprite such as Plumeria? What kind of monster are you? I have a mind to teach you a lesson, friend!”
This abrupt mood change leads you to think this character is a few cards short of a full deck.
What do you say now?
- *“Sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it. I’m on a quest, that’s all.” Go to entry APOLOGIZE*
- *“Oh ok then, I will take a blessing.” Go to entry BLESSING*
- *Turn and depart at a run... this man seems a bit dangerous and unpredictable. Go to entry SCARPER*

## DEEPCAVE
You ponder the fate of these poor souls, whose bones lay in a pile in the middle of the floor. Why did they not leave? After reasoning it through, you decide that the only reason must be that they were trapped in here somehow. But by what? The river? What sort of end did they come to, stuck here in this cave? You shake your head in disbelief and horror.
To search the bonepile, make an investigation roll, DC 10.
- *If successful, go to SEARCHCAVE*
- *If unsuccessful, go to CAVECLUES*
- *If you would rather not, go to entry LEAVECAVERN*

## DEEPCURRENT
There is something about this river that causes your Divine Sense to tingle. You move forward, and dip a hand into it, feel the water in your palm. It caresses your skin gently, infusing you with sacred potency…
This entire river, or at least this section of it, is holy water!
If you wish, you may empty out your waterskin and replace the contents with holy water. You can still drink it as normal water, but the holy water may be useful against any undead you encounter.
- *When you are ready, you may return to the previous entry, CAVESTREAM, and continue from there.
  


## DEEPWOODS
You edge forward warily, checking the ground and the trees above for traps. Who knows what deadly plans the inhabitants of this wood have in store for hapless travellers!  
Make a perception check, DC 15.
- *If you fail, go to entry AMBUSH?*
- *If you succeed, go to FREEPASS*

## DEFUSE
“Stop!” you yell at the top of your lungs. Shocked at this exclamation, the goblins halt their advance.
“Attacking me would be foolish, little goblins,” you say, extending your hands, palms down, in a gesture of placation. “Do you know who I am?”
Make a charisma check, DC 16.
- *If you are successful, go to entry SILVERTONGUE*
- *If you fail, go to UNCONVINCING*

## DENYEVERYTHING
You have no way of knowing whether this ent is a friend or an enemy of the Death Knight. Evil ents are not unheard of in these parts – maligned, twisted old trees who take pleasure in the suffering of humans, elves and other two-legged creatures.
“Just passing through, old one,” you say. The ent eyes you doubtfully. “Hm,” he grunts, squinting his eyes. “Well then, don’t dawdle too long about it,” he booms. “This wood is no place to linger for such creatures as yourself. There are many hidden dangers in the Wood you call the Weathercote. Be off with you!”
And with that, he turns and stalks back into the forest, quickly disappearing from sight.
- *Return to tilepage 5 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## DETECTEVIL
Deduct one spell slot.
You cast the spell, and immediately feel it: the presence of powerful undead within this crypt.
- *To enter, go to entry CROSSTHRESHOLD*
- *Otherwise, you can leave by going to LEAVECEMETERY*

## DETECTRING
Deduct one spell slot.
You focus all your attention on the ring, trying to get inside its true nature. After some time it comes to you; the magic inherent in the ring belongs to the School of Enchantment.
As the nature of the ring’s magic comes to you, you look closer at it. Finely etched around the little gold band are fine engravings, the shapes of animals: a bird, this is a Ring of Animal Friendship!
- *Add the ring to your inventory if you desire, and then Return to tilepage 5 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## DEVIOUS
The entry to the crypt appears trap-free. Gingerly, you ease the gates open. The metal seems to be relatively rust free and does not creak as you expected it would. Easing yourself within the gates, you grasp the handle of the left stone door and lean back. It swings smoothly out.
- *You proceed inside. Go to entry CROSSTHRESHOLD*

## DIGESCAPE
Sighing with resignation, you take your weapon and start digging holes in the dirt, footholds for you to climb up. The job takes quite some time, causing you to break into a sweat!
- *Roll a d4. If the result is 4, go to entry RETURN*
- *If the result is 1,2 or 3, go to MADETT*

## DIGGER
The approaching creature must be a bit slow. Working as fast as you can, you manage to create the last of your steps and quickly scale the side of the pit, turning to face whatever approaches.
A robed woman, on the path ahead, stops in her tracks. “Wha – How did you get out?” she exclaims, infuriated at the fact that you have escaped her trap. Without another word, she angrily takes out a crossbow and begins loading a bolt.
- *Go to entry CULTISTCOMBAT*

## DILLYDALLY
As you are moving back towards the entrance that leads back to the surface, you hear voices! Voices speaking Common, laughing and conversing loudly. They are getting closer.
- *There is a largish pile of boulders nearby. To hide behind these, go to entry HIDEOUICK*
- *To stand in the open and face whoever approaches (if they come down the hole that is) go to entry NOTAFRAID*

## DISCERN
Even someone who had lived in the city their entire life could discern that whatever creature shed this blood, it was heading east as it did so. And as you look east, squinting ahead along the forest path, you fancy you can see a junction ahead where another path branches off to the north. It is hard to tell with trees encroaching on every inch of the path around here!
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## DISCLOSURE
You begin telling your story, the quest your are on for the Brewmonts, looking for their grandson; how you came to be here in Weathercote Wood, and everything that has happened so far.
As you talk, you notice the three thieves, the older man, the young boy and the woman exchanging looks. The more you talk, the less they interrupt, and simply listen to your story.

When you finally finish, there is a long silence.
Finally the older man, the one who seems like the leader of this little band of thieves, speaks.
“My friend… we had no idea. We blundered into the Death Knight’s lair, once before, seeking treasure. We had no idea what the place really was. We escaped there with our lives, barely.”
“Then untie me!” you demand. “And let me continue on my quest.”
The leader directs the boy to untie you, and he quickly does so. The leader motions the female thief to him and whispers something in her ear. She moves away quickly.
As you massage your wrists and ankles, you are brought water to drink, and some bread. The leader then crouches by your side, producing a map. You bite into the bread, surprised at how hungry you are.
“Here,” he says, pointing to the small piece of parchment. “The lair of the one you seek.”
Go to the tilepage booklet and turn to the very back. You will see a hand-drawn map on the last page. This is what he is showing you.
“We went in there not long after we first arrived in Weathercote,” the thief says quietly. “We thought the place abandoned, but no. This Death Knight you seek, he is in there. And probably keeping this boy Darek captive there too. As you can see, the map is incomplete. We were chased out of there before we could progress further, but I am sure his lair is just a little further on. I don’t think the crypt went that far back.”
You pore over the map. “And how do I get here,” you ask, tapping the page. “To the crypt. Where is the entrance?”
The man exchanges looks with the other two, then turns back to you. “If you are set on going there, I will give you the directions. It is north from here. You go past the junction, and it is the first left. The crypt is on the far side of the cemetery. But beware! I have a feeling that the Death Knight has become even more powerful since we last visited him. Go cautiously, try to be unnoticed... like a shadow!” You eat a little more and then thank the band of thieves (recover 2hp). They do not let you take any gold, but do gift you with one healing potion, a blue coloured tincture in an ornate bottle, which you accept gratefully, and the map, which they also let you keep.

- *Add these items to your inventory and leave this thieves’ den! Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## DISTURBED
You are woken at midnight by a sound that makes you sit bolt upright – an unearthly howl, that sounds not even animal, certainly not human... You are in a dream when you hear it, and the spine-chilling sound mingles with your dream. It is still going when you wake up and then trails off, the last rising note haunted with agony. Gods, what could make a sound like that? Disturbed to the core, you try to settle down and get back to sleep, but it is hopeless. You are on edge for the rest of the night. Recover a hit die minus 1hp for your disturbed sleep. If you roll 1 or 2, take the average for your hit die instead. Yeah – I’m a nice DM. As dawn begins to creep into the sky, you pack away your bedroll and quietly make your way back out to the path.
- *Return to the tilepage 8 entry and continue from the last direction you read*

## DITCHPACK
Quickly you wriggle out of the straps of your pack and keep swimming towards the far shore. The only thing you are able to save is your weapon and whatever else is tucked securely into your belt. Erase your backpack and everything kept within it, including your provisions, from your inventory.

Bedraggled and panting, you finally wash up on the far shore, thanking the gods you didn’t drown! Deduct 1 hp for your efforts. After some time you get your breath back and then finally gather enough energy to make your way back upstream to the cave. A chilly breeze seems to be coming from within the cave, and a strange smell also... kind of like mouldy rot. Around the entrance, embedded in the earth are broken shards of pottery and other detritus.
- *To enter the cave, got to entry ENTERCAVE*

## DKQUESTION
“Death Knight?” the stranger says quizzically. “Such things do not exist in this wood my friend, or if they do, they have not met the great Shagaxa yet!” The stranger puffs up his chest at these words. Obviously he speaks of himself, but you can’t help thinking he’s not quite right in the head. He smiles at you. “So, will you take a blessing from little Plumeria here?” he asks.
- *To take him up on his offer, go to entry BLESSING*
- *To politely refuse, go to entry DECLINE*

## DOGLEG
As you pass the corner, you feel the ground drop about an inch underfoot, and hear a ‘click’ sound. Can’t be good.
Make a dexterity saving throw, DC 15. Make this throw with advantage if your barbarian danger sense was activated earlier.
- *If successful, go to entry BLADEDODGE*
- *If unsuccessful, go to SWINGER*

## DOORCHECK
Move your token up to the stone building if its not already. You start inspecting the handle and all around the door, looking for booby traps, or traps of any description.
- *Roll perception, DC 14. If successful, go to entry ENTRANCETRAP?*
- *If you fail, go to entry ALLCLEAR?*

## DRYBONES
As you walk forward, you notice a thick grey fog spreading over the track… Hand on your weapon, you freeze, rigid, as the fog rolls towards you. It is still some meters away, but it turns and billows like steam from a boiling cauldron.
From the middle of this strange mist, a figure emerges… an armoured skeleton! He carries a sword and a shield, and seeing you, lets out a ghastly rattling noise, somewhere between laughter and a dying breath. He limps forward, raising his blade. You steady yourself, drawing your weapon. Looks like its bonecrunching time!
- *Are you a cleric? If so, you could try to turn this undead warrior! Go to entry TURNSKELETON*
- *If not, you will simply have to hack away at this bag of bones! Go to entry SKELETONBATTLE*

## DUCKUNDER
You crouch as you make your way forward along the path, taking care to stay below the level of the glyph. If there is any sort of effect that it is supposed to emanate, you seem to be avoiding it.
- *Do you want to investigate the hut? If so, go to entry LITTLEHUT.*
- *If not, return to tilepage 6 and continue from the last direction you read*

## DUKEITOUT
Frothing like some crazed animal, the Death Knight harnesses his rage once more and attacks!
Roll a d20+5 with advantage a final time, with 1d8+3 slashing damage if it hits. Continue the combat between yourself and the Death Knight (and Darek too, if you tossed him a blade). The Death Knight’s stats are below, minus feats. From now on he will only attack using Hellreaver, his longsword +1.

### DEATH KNIGHT

**Hit Points** 28 (minus dmg already caused)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

- *If you defeat the Death Knight, go to entry VICTORIOUS*
- *If you are defeated, go to entry VALIANTDEFEAT*

## EASYPATH
You leave the cemetery, a little voice inside you chiding you for your cowardice. Scared of a graveyard, a hardened adventurer like you?

You return to the junction and see the grassland ahead. It would be so easy to leave right now, just abandon the quest and depart this area completely.

If you are still thinking of rescuing Darek Brewmont, you get the nagging feeling that he may be running out of time.
- *To head north towards the grasslands, go to entry QUESTABANDON*
- *To return to the cemetery, go to tilepage 10 and follow the instructions there*
- *Or you may return south to the four-way junction. Go to entry BACKTOJUNCTION*

## ENOUGHOFTHIS!
Aborting your attempt to cross the river, you turn and swim back the way you came, finally flopping onto the shore you left from, panting and coughing up water.

*Erase your provisions from your inventory – they are ruined!*

Finally you get your breath back and assess your situation.
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## ENRAGED
The figure rolls out of the way just in time, and your attack goes flying into the forest behind.

Throwing her hood back, the robed female screams in rage. “How dare you attack one of the order of the Kiaransalee!” she screams, producing a hand crossbow which she immediately begins loading.
- *You’ll need to keep those ranged attacks going now! Go to entry CULTISTCOMBAT*

## ENTERCAVE
You cautiously step inside the cave entrance, feeling the cool, slightly stale air surround you.
- *Go to sub-map 1 (after the tilepages in the Maps Booklet) and then proceed to the sub-map 1 entry in this booklet.*

## ENTERPASSAGE
You enter the quiet, cool passage and pad softly down the corridor. Soon you are at the top of a flight of stone stairs, looking down.
(This is presuming you have a source of light, or darkvision. If you do not have darkvision and do not have a source of light handy, then your character will know to turn around and leave this place. If you do have a source of light, activate it and continue! See the intro section on darkvision).
You quietly walk down the stairs, keeping an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. Could this be the place where Darek Brewmont is being held? You hold your breath, fearful of making any sound to disturb the deathly still air.
Slowly you descend to the bottom of the stairs, where a medium-sized chamber lies. This room was once a monastery of some sort, used by devotees of Amaunator for meditation. Although what it’s doing so far out in the wilderness is anyone’s guess.
Are you a paladin or a cleric? If so, you could pray to Amaunator for inspiration. Roll a d100. If you score 50 or above, award yourself 1 inspiration point, which you can use to award yourself advantage, once, when making a saving throw or an attack roll.
- *To inspect the area around the altar, go to entry INSPECTALTAR*
- *To have a general search around the room, go to entry EXPLOREROOM*
- *To turn around and leave, return to tilepages and continue from the last direction you read.*

## ENTRANCETOMB
You walk slowly forward, primed for any surprises that might suddenly present themselves.
As you near the crypt, you see that it is ornately carved, and also set into a solid bank of earth that sits behind it. It appears the crypt extends underground some way. It doesn’t take a dwarf to see that whoever this was constructed for was lavish in their tastes.
Above the door is a coat of arms with a small plaque set beneath. It reads:

*Together for all eternity, abiding peacefully in the Rays of Amaunator, the Family of-*

When the name of this family was presumably carved before, now the marble has been chipped away until unrecognizable. You can possibly see the top of an ‘a’ near the middle of what used to be the name, but that is all.

You see that the gates, and the double stone doors beyond are ever so slightly ajar. They appear open.
- *To check the entrance for traps, go to GATETRAP*
- *To skip that part and just open the gates, go to GETINSIDE*

## ENTRANCETRAP?
Your keen eye could have just saved your life! Closely inspecting the door, you notice a catch mechanism cleverly hidden under the large metal ring handle on the right door.
- *Do you want to try and disarm it? You will need thieves’ tools to do so. If you want to attempt this, go to entry NIMBLEFINGERS*
- *If you don’t have thieves’ tools, but want to try and open the door anyway, go to entry OPENSTONEDOOR*
- *If you would rather leave it and continue north, Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read*

## EXCULTIST
Add 25 XP.
The female cultist carries little in the way of her equipment. You may take her weapons (hand crossbow, 18 bolts, scimitar).
She does carry two items of interest: a map of the town of Orlbar, with various houses mapped in red. And these houses all have the word “here” written next to them. Around her neck is an amulet of some kind. It is made of dull steel, and is a simple flat coin with an image of a red gauntlet on it. You have no idea what either of these signifies. Add these items to your inventory if you wish, and continue on your way!
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read*

## EXPERTISE
“Show me your weapon,” Plumeria says.
You do so. The little fairy alights on it, and you hear a faint, barely audible incantation.
“It is done,” she says. “When you are ready, kiss your weapon twice and it will become enchanted with woodland magic! And now…” Plumeria flutters back up to your shoulder, and whispers in your ear, “Run! Get away, while you still can! He’s insane!”
You may use Plumeria’s blessing in any encounter, making your weapon +1. It will last for the duration of one battle, although you wonder what your enemies will think when they see you kiss your weapon during battle!
- *Wasting no more time, you get out of there quickly! Go to entry SCARPER*

## EXPLOREROOM
There are numerous nooks and alcoves around the side of this dusty room, many of them hidden in darkness. You search, mindful of traps, but also on the lookout for any items of interest. As you walk, small puffs of dust rise up, seemingly undisturbed for a long time; years, maybe decades.
- *Make an investigation check. If you score 1-10, go to entry NOTBAD.*
- *If you score 11-15, go to entry BETTER*
- *If you score 16 or above, go to entry REALLYGOOD*

## EXTRACAUTIOUS
You think better of descending into the gaping hole, and instead consider your options at the four way junction.
- *Return to the tilepage 8 entry and continue from the last direction you read*

## EXTRICATE
With a violent elbow backwards into the guts of whatever has a hold of you, you force it to release you and jump to your feet, quickly pulling yourself up and out of the grave.
- *Go to entry ZOMBIEBATTLE*

## EXUDING
You sense the presence of undead nearby. Your heart races. Could this be the Death Knight’s Lair? It certainly seems a likely location!
- *To move forward and investigate the crypt doors, go to entry ENTRANCETOMB*

## FAIRYQUESTION
“Ah, this is my little friend, Plumeria! She grants blessings, would you like one?”
- *To answer “Yes, I would!” go to entry BLESSING*
- *To answer, “No thanks, that’s allright,” go to entry DECLINE*

## FANATICSBATTLE
Place two tokens on the map, within melee range of your token, to represent the two cultists. Roll initiative and do battle with these lunatics!

### CULTISTS
Medium Human, Lawful Evil

**Armour Class** 12  
**Hit Points** 9  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 11 (0)  
**DEX** 12 (+1)  
**CON** 10 (0)

**Dark Devotion** The cultist has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened

### ATTACKS
**Scimitar** +2 to hit, 1d6 piercing damage

- *If you are successful, go to entry ZEALOTSSNOMORE*
- *If you are defeated, go to entry OHWELL*

## FLAILING
You are now in danger, and must ditch your pack if you want to make it the whole way across. If you do not, you run the very real risk of drowning.
- *To ditch your pack, go to DITCHPACK*
- *To try and keep hold of your pack, go to SKETCHY*

## FLAMEWEB
You produce your flint and tinder and start trying to light some tinder to create fire...
You crouch down, working the stone, trying to produce a fire that can burn the webs away.
- *Did you succeed in an earlier stealth check? If so, go to entry HEREWEGO.*
- *If you did not make a stealth check, or if you failed one, go to entry OHNO.*

## FLYESCAPE
Hovering easily up and out of the pit trap, you thank the creator that made you the way you are! Smiling broadly, you come to rest gently at the side of the pit. Looking ahead, you focus back on your quest and resume your progress down the path.
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## FOOTHOLDS
You carefully climb down. There is a drop, about 15 ft or so, but you use several rocky crags to make the descent a bit easier. Reaching the bottom you see a passage of sorts, more a kind of winding burrow, extending ahead. You begin to make your way slowly down it. Outside it was nearing evening, and thus inside here it grows dark, but ahead you see a source of light!
- *To head towards this light source, go to entry TOTHELIGHT*
- *To leave this place and climb back up to the surface, Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## FORESTTRAPS
You have a good look around, but cannot see anything that looks trap-like around here. Still cautious, you move forward.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## FORWARD
You edge forward, drawing your weapon and keeping watch on all sides. After all, where there’s webs...
You stop before the first web, a thick mass of silken threads. It looks tough; an ordinary weapon is going to struggle to cut through this.
- *Do you know any flame-producing cantrips or spells? Or, do you possess Alchemists Fire? If so, go to entry BURNWEB.*
- *What about the Mage Hand cantrip? If you want to try this, go to entry SHIFTWEB.*
- *Thunderwave spell? Go to entry THUNDERWEB.*
- *If you want to try and use ordinary fire to burn them away, go to entry FLAMEWEB.*
- *If you’d prefer to try and move them with your weapon, go to entry SLASHWEB*
- *Or, you could just throw something at the web and see what happens? Go to TESTWEB*

## FREEPASS
You notice a patch of the forest path that looks a bit out of place. Staying back and poking around with a stick, you can see that someone has dug a pit trap here. Who knows that they had planned for whoever fell in! You skirt around the outside of the pit trap and continue on the path.
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read*

## FRIENDLYCHAP
After showing you his wares, Mikadus claps you firmly on the back.
“Well met, my friend!” he exclaims cheerfully as his assistant loads up the poor pony again, who was beginning to look relieved at having its load removed. “I wish you luck on your journey, wherever you are heading!”
Before you can get another word in, the talkative merchant has turned his back and departed, the pony labouring under the weight of its load once more.
You can’t help thinking that Mikadus Fairweather is the happiest merchant you have ever met.
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read*

## FUNKYFUNGI
Suddenly it comes to you! Yes, you thought it had seemed familiar. These are Grakspores, and they are well-known to warriors, emboldening them before going into battle. Overjoyed at this find, you begin gathering the fungi into a small pouch. Weathercote Wood is certainly full of surprises!
Grakspores will grant immunity to the frightened condition or any fear effect, at full effectiveness for one hour. They can effectively be used for one encounter and can be consumed as a free action, after which they take effect immediately. Add them to your inventory.
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## GARB
You make your way quietly up the path, keeping an eye out for enemies.
To your right, something catches your eye, something moving in the trees. You freeze, hand on your weapon, and look closer, squinting through the dense undergrowth. It appears to be a cloak, hanging from a branch and moving slightly in the breeze. It is a deep green, a forest green, easily missed.
- *To inspect this cloak, go to entry CLOAKCHECK*
- *To ignore it and keep going, Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read*

## GASSED
Roll 1d4 and take that much poison damage. If this causes you to die, go to entry OHWELL. Otherwise, continue reading below.
You don’t remember anything after the gas hit you in the face. You wake up, still within the mine, but your head is pounding, and you find you are bound hand and foot. Your mouth is gagged also. As your vision clears, you see that you are surrounded by three figures – all human. Gradually your sight improves a little more and you see that they are all what you would call, ‘the adventuring type’. Probably rogues.
The first one, an older man, smiles on seeing you awake. He has a long, deep scar across his cheek, and a rough-looking face.
“Ah! We didn’t kill him after all. That’s good.”
“Nice try,” says another, a younger man, in his teens, walking forward and crouching down. “But you should have known. Shouldn’t you? You should have recognized the workmanship. We’re not playing around here. We’re not new to this game.”
Then the third, a darkly-dressed female, speaks up. “Now the only question that remains is… what do we do with you?”
The rough-looking older man speaks again. “Remove his gag,” he orders the boy, who immediately obeys. You cough a little, smacking your lips to try and get a bit of moisture back into your parched mouth.
“Speak!” the man says. “Who are you?”
- *Do you tell this thief of your quest? Go to DISCLOSURE*
- *Or will you make something up? Go to SPINYARN*

## GATETRAP
Make a perception roll, DC 12
- *If successful, go to DEVIOUS*
- *If unsuccessful, go to BATEDBREATH*

## GETINSIDE
Steeling yourself, you pull the gate smoothly open... nothing happens.
You congratulate yourself on trusting your instincts and open the stone door too, pulling it out.
There is a sucking sound as the air of the crypt is replaced by the outside air. You stare within the depths, and see a passageway that appears to open into a chamber after some way.
- *Do you know the spell Detect Good and Evil? You can cast it by going to DETECTEVIL*
- *Alternately, you can move inside by going to entry CROSSTHRESHOLD*

## GOAROUND
You go around the eastern side of the tree, taking care to crouch as well, just to be safe. If there is some sort of effect inherent in this glyph, you have managed to avoid it. Good work!
However, could you go to the hut, visit there, while avoiding any effects the glyph had? Perhaps the glyph itself is redundant?
There is no way of telling!
- *To investigate the little house, go to entry LITTLEHUT*
- *To ignore the little house and continue down the path, Return to tilepage 6 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## GIFTOFGAB
The thief leader nods slowly. “Very well then,” he says quietly, and directs the boy to bring you your things and release your bonds. “Get you gone then.” he points towards the exit.
Quickly you exit the hole back into the night, and walk some way, looking back, making sure you are not followed. Then you turn back and make your way through the wood, to just north of where you were before.
- *Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## GOBLINBATTLE
Place three tokens on the map to represent the goblins, roll initiative and do battle! The goblins attack all at once, one attack each. The spear goblin will hang back for the first attack and throw his spear, then will rush forward to retrieve it while the other two attack with staff and goblin battleaxe respectively.
As a free action, you could try to stand on the thrown spear (if it misses) to stop the spear goblin from retrieving it. In order to do this, and not lower your AC, make a dex check, DC 16. If you manage to do this, the spear goblin will miss his 2nd turn, but you’ll need to take your foot off it to attack again, and then he will retrieve and use as a melee weapon from that point on.

### GOBLINS
Small Humanoid, Neutral Evil

**Armour Class** 15

- *If you are victorious, go to entry DEADGOBLINS*
- *If you are defeated go to OHWELL*

## GOBLINGIFT
The goblin leader is exceedingly pleased with your gift. He pockets it and then comes close, lowering his voice.
“If it is the Death Knight you come to face, man-traveller, then you ought to know this…” And he points at the red tree, which is still visible through the undergrowth, west of the path. “Take a branch from that tree and make a stake from it. That’s the only way he can be killed. Otherwise, you can only stop him for a while! If you don’t kill him, he’ll hunt you down mercilessly! Many of your kind have died that way.”
You consider these words, and thank the goblin leader for his help. The goblins totter off, fighting over the gift you just gave them, and you are left alone once more.
- *Return to tilepage 5 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## GOODSHOT
You hear your arrow make its mark, and hear a cry of pain – definitely not human, you know that much. However, the creature hardly slows, and soon it is out of sight, disappeared within the dark green of Weathercote Wood.
- *Go to entry DEADNELLY.*

## GOTTHEDROP
You round the corner, and the track points itself north again. You adjust your pack on your back, taking a deep breath and forging ahead.
Suddenly, you feel something drop on your head… a net! There is a screeching sound, and through the mesh of the net you see three goblins, coming at you with weapons raised!
Make a dexterity save, DC 17.
- *If you succeed, go to NETESCAPE*
- *If you fail, go to ROUNDONE*

## GRAVETRAPS
As you peer into the graveyard, trying to make a visual inspection, you notice that the ground on one of the graves seems suspiciously fresh, as if recently disturbed. You make a note to avoid that area.
- *To proceed towards the crypt, go to SOFTLY*
- *To leave the cemetery, go to LEAVECEMETERY*
- *Are you a barbarian? If so, go to entry BEARINGS*

## GREYBARKCONVO
You tell Greybark everything to do with your adventure. He listens with rapt attention, nodding every now and then. When you are finished, he says to you, “And did you take a branch from the red tree, to fashion a stake? For it is the only way the Death Knight can be truly killed.”
*If you have not, Greybark directs you to go and do this now. Add a Red Tree Stake to your inventory.*
“Your quest is noble, traveller,” Greybark says. “And unlike many I have seen enter these woods, you look as though may just be able to accomplish it.” He smiles, the wood around his mouth creaking as it forms a kindly smile.

You thank Greybark, and ask him if there is any way he can help you in your quest.
“As a matter of fact, young traveller, I can!” Greybark reaches up to his head and snaps off a long branch, then begins working with his hands on the branch, stripping the leaves and smaller branches off, gradually fashioning it into something. As he works, he also sings, a deep sonorous sound, and birds begin to flock around him, landing on his shoulders. They begin to shed feathers, and Greybark plucks these out of the airs, stripping smaller branches and adding the feathers to the end. In what seems like a very short time, there is a pile at his feet, a pile of arrows.

Gently, Greybark places a bow into your hands. It is finely made, as if crafted by expert elven bowyers, and the arrows are perfectly straight. However, it still has a certain rough wildness to it, a rustic appearance.

You take it up and test it. It is probably the best bow you have ever handled.
*Greybark’s gift is a longbow+1! Add this very special gift, and 20 arrows, to your inventory.*

Greybark converses with you for a little while longer, and then informs you he has ‘things to attend to.’
“Good luck, traveller!” he booms, and then turns and walks away. Within moments he has merged back into the forest.

Shaking your head in wonderment at this encounter, you turn your attention back to your quest and the task at hand.
- *Return to tilepage 5 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## GREYBEAM
The beam hits you, and you feel a horrible sensation spread through you. You look down, and see your torso transforming into grey rock… the effect spreads outwards, extending to your limbs and your extremities.

You are petrified!

The strange little man laughs and flops back down on the moss. “Excellent!” he exclaims. “Another decoration for my little woodland glade! What do you think, Plumeria?”

You cannot move, cannot cry out… all you can do is think, “How the hell did I get myself in this mess?”

You stay like that for some time, frozen on the path, at the mercy of the elements.
- *Go to entry WHATSMYFATE*

## HANKY
As you move cautiously forward, keeping a watch on all sides, you see something small being blown in the wind down the path towards you. As it passes you quickly trap it with your booted foot, then retrieve it from the ground for closer inspection. It is a handkerchief, white silk and slightly dirtied, with the initials “D.B.” embroidered into one corner. Darek Brewmont! Perhaps he dropped it, as a sign? You raise it to your nose and give it a sniff, and immediately choke on the hideous aroma. It smells like death, like the grave. Your heart drops – could the boy already be dead? Perhaps you are too late. Gritting your teeth determinedly, you shake these grim thoughts away and continue on your quest.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read*

## HARMLESS
There is an audible ‘click’ as the catch mechanism is released. You sigh with relief, and give the door a pull. It swings smoothly open, revealing a dark passageway. Some way inside you can see that a set of stairs leads down.
- *To enter the passage, go to ENTERPASSAGE*
- *To leave and continue north, go back to Tilepage 3 and continue from the last line you read.*

## HASTYCARAVAN
Despite your victory, the words of the Blood Knight are still fresh in your mind. Turning north at the junction that led you to the cemetery, you continue for a short way, and finally Weathercote ends, and the landscape changes to wide, open grasslands. The sky is overcast, threatening rain, and pulling poor Darek behind you, you proceed at a run to a nearby farmhouse where you steal a horse. The farmer comes out of his house as you gallop away, shouting and waving his fists at your back. You reach Orlbar that evening, and deliver Darek to his grateful grandparents. “You shall be rewarded, brave champion,” Lord Brewmont promises, his eyes misting over. “On the morrow, I shall go to the Orlbar bank, and –“ You cut Lord Brewmont off, informing him that there is no time. You tell him that he must organize a caravan, and leave for Loudwater immediately, and you plead with him to trust your word. The Brewmonts leave for Loudwater that evening, with you and Lord Brewmont riding alongside, keeping watch. The journey takes several days, but finally you reach Loudwater With the Death Knight and the Blood Knight on your mind, your sleep is uneasy for weeks to come, haunted by visions. The Death Knight will haunt Orlbar once more… perhaps you will return one day and finish the job. But for now, you will be looking over your shoulder, keeping an eye on anyone in a robe… Now the Blood Knight has physical form, he will pursue you to the ends of the realm, and possibly beyond, with his army of cultists. It is time to disappear! You certainly didn’t want those fanatics following you to the village of Orlbar. That would have put all these poor folk in danger. So you resolve to deal with that danger when it presents itself. The Brewmonts pay you the promised 2000 gp, which is welcome, but it can’t relieve the weight on your mind. Poor Orlbar… no doubt the Death Knight will find another squire, in time.
- *Go to entry SPOILSOFADVENTURE*

## HEREWEGO
Suddenly you hear a rustling, movement off to the right side of the path. Suddenly, from the undergrowth, two GIANT WOLF SPIDERS appear! Seeing you in their territory, the rear up, hissing horribly, and launch themselves at you!
- *Go to entry SPIDERBATTLE.*

## HIDDENDANGER
You give the place a thorough visual search, but see nothing that looks suspicious.
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read*

## HIDEOUCK
You duck behind the boulder pile as fast as you can, just in time to see legs appearing through the hole.
Make a stealth check, DC 14.
- *If you are successful, go to entry INVISIBLE*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to entry SLOPPY*

## HISSANDABANG
At seeing your illusion, what you hoped to be an impressive diversion ends up serving as a source of comedy! The three rogues double over in fits of laughter.
“Oh! Oh, that’s priceless!” the leader gasps between guffaws, holding his sides. “You are too funny my friend! Oh my…” Despite your embarrassment, you think you see an opportunity, and try to slink away as the three are consumed by hilarity. However, the woman’s smile quickly disappears and she levels her blade at you, stopping you from escaping.
Gradually they regain their composure.
“Well, I’d like to say ‘good try’, but that would be lying,” the leader says. He motions with his head back towards the passage that leads to their lair. “That way,” he commands.
- *Go to entry BLADEPOINT*

## HMMM
You make what you think is a pretty thorough search, but cannot find any kind of booby trap on the chest.
- *If you want to try and open the chest, go to PICKLOCK*
- *If you would rather try something else, return to entry TOTHELIGHT and choose another option from the bottom of that entry*

## HOLDBREATH
Roll 1d4 and take half that much poison damage, rounding down (max 2hp).
You manage to close your mouth just in time, and get quickly out of the way of the noxious vapour stream. Coughing violently, you move and get out of the little space.
You decide you will wait some time for the gas to clear. However, just as it becomes nearly safe to move back into the space, you hear something.
Voices! Getting closer too, although you can’t tell from what direction.
There is nowhere to hide in here, and no exit that you can see. Quickly and quietly you run out into the area just below the entrance hole, searching for somewhere to hide. The voices are getting louder, like they are approaching the entrance hole.
- *There is a largish pile of boulders nearby. To hide behind these, go to entry HIDEOUCK*
- *To stand in the open and face whoever approaches (if they come down the hole that is) go to entry NOTAFRAID*

## HOLDTHATTHOUGHT
You take several steps up the path, then all of a sudden something bizarre happens. You are frozen, mid-step! Not frozen with cold, but paralyzed, from head to toe. One foot hovers in the air… it is if you have been stopped in time!
Make a wisdom saving throw, DC 15.
- *If you succeed, go to entry UNFROZEN*
- *If you fail, go to entry PRESERVED*

## HUTTRAPS
You search all around the door frame, and the ground, but cannot find anything that looks like a trap here. Cautiously you put your hand on the door handle and quietly push down…
- *Go to CABINENTRY*

## IGNOREINSTINCTS
The sky darkens, and you hear a faint scream, followed by another crack of thunder, and then something like the neigh of a horse… if it is a horse, it is straight out of the depths of hell.
Time has run out for poor Darek Brewmont! The Death Knight has found his squire, and you have failed in your quest!
- *Go to entry OHWELL*

## INDUCTED
Within the cabin there is a kind of burnt smell, like smouldering embers, and the room has only the most basic furniture. A table, a couple of chairs, a fireplace…
Suddenly your heart stops. In the darkness, you see a figure, standing against one of the walls, completely silent, watching you. A tall figure, and dressed all in armour. As you watch, this figure begins to glow, red in the darkness, and you see that it is in fact a knight! A sinister-looking tower of a Knight, holding a huge greatsword that shimmers with an unearthly radiance.
The Death Knight?

Feeling a cold sweat break out on your brow, you feel for your weapon… No, that’s gone, as are all your supplies.
“Do not bother searching for your equipment, mortal,” a voice booms… it must be the Knight’s although it seems to come from all around you rather than from his direction.
“Listen mortal, and listen carefully!” the voice booms again. “I have a task for you. There is a knight who claims ownership over this forest, a warrior who, like myself, is not of this realm……”
A chill travels up your spine. The voice is deep, booming, but hollow and devoid of life. At least now you know you’re not speaking to the Death Knight. Who could this be then?
“My followers call me the Blood Knight of Kiaransalee. I am a loyal follower of Kiaransalee, the Dark Goddess, Enemy of Lolth and Orcus, The Vengeful Banshee!”
These names make your blood run cold. You had thought that the Cult of Kiaransalee was long dead. Their deeds are detailed in ancient histories, and they are responsible for numerous atrocities throughout the ages.

“My followers and I will see the Mother return to her former power… and we have chosen this Wood of Weathercote as the point of her arrival. It is aligned with the unseen stars and the nodes of power that exist in this land… it is a small but potent place.
“But this one who they call the Death Knight… He must die, mortal. And you have been chosen by the Goddess as the bringer of his demise!”
Your spirits lift a little. Isn’t this your quest anyway? You are about to voice agreement when the Blood Knight adds, “And as reward, you will become my most exalted follower! My general, who shall stand beside me in glory as we return the Goddess Kiaransalee to her rightful place as ruler of this land!”
This part, you are not so much in agreeance with. You are stunned into silence. The Blood Knight continues. “You must leave this place now.” He walks forward, taking a couple of massive steps towards you, and red sparks skitter out from his feet as he walks. “Do not be afraid mortal. I am Myrkbrood, made from the embers of the cremated dead. And this weapon is of the Myrk as well!” From some unseen place the Blood Knight produces a long sword, glowing with a red light, as if embers burn inside it. “This is known as a Sword of the Goddess’s Wrath. You will use it to slay the one known as the Death Knight! And then, return it to me before the dawn. If you refuse any part of this task, my followers will pursue you to the ends of the world! You shall live a cursed life, always looking over your shoulder. Are we in agreeance, mortal?”
You take the sword in your hand. It pulsates with a volatile potency, and almost hurts to hold. The dark energy runs up your arm and you feel a little of it creep into your very soul. What is your response to the Blood Knight?
- *“Hell yeah, sign me up!” Go to entry DARKQUEST*
- *“Aaahhh yeah, the first part of what you say, I can do that. But the whole becoming your general thing… Not so sure.” Go to entry NEGOTIATE*
- *“Do you know what Blood Knight? Take your Sword of Whatever and stick it where the sun don’t shine!” Go to entry BALLSYMOVE*

## INSPECTALTAR
You walk up to the large bronze idol of Amaunator. It is exceptionally well made, and seems like it was just placed here yesterday. The metal gleams dully as you move around it. Then, as you move behind the altar, you see something small lying on the ground. A holy symbol of Amaunator! It is on a long, steel chain to be worn around the neck, and is in the image of a large effulgent sun with runes on the front. This perhaps belonged to a cleric, monk or paladin.

Take the item if you wish, placing it into your backpack.
- *If you wish to inspect the room, go to entry EXPLOREROOM*
- *If you are done here, and wish to leave, go to entry LEAVECHAMBER*

## INTHEKNOW
Quickly you rattle off a couple of sentences in Thieves’ Cant. Something about honour among thieves… or the lack of it.
“And what did you take from us?” the man replies in Thieves’ Cant also, advancing and sheathing his weapon, while the other two keep their crossbows trained on you. He searches you thoroughly, retrieving anything you had taken. (Adjust inventory).
Standing, he smiles. “No harm done, stranger. I would have done the same at your age. Now, on your way!”
Realizing you are getting off very lucky, you climb up towards the exit, crossbows following you the whole way, and are soon back above ground.
- *Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## INVESTIGATESPIDERS
You start to look around, searching the bush by the track and seeing if you can find anything – or anyone – the spiders may have stashed nearby.
Just off the path, you find several dried up corpses, wrapped in old webs – the remains of a few hapless travellers. A quick look through the pockets of a dead orc turns up 21 copper pieces and a dagger. A further search of two human corpses produces a heavy crossbow and… jackpot! A bottle labelled “Potion of Healing”! You even recognize the script: it’s from a reputable dealer in Neverwinter who you have bought potions from before.
You drop the items into your backpack and move back onto the path.
- *Go back to Tilepage 2 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## INVISIBLE
You crouch, well out of sight. The voices come near, talking in common.
“…at the end of next week. How long did you say the journey was, Bradigan?”
“That’s right, I forget you’ve never been to Neverwinter before, country boy! Well, about two weeks, but if we find horses we could cut that by half, and then…”
The voices fade out once more. Gingerly you step out from behind the pile, and, carefully peering down the passage towards the abandoned mine, quietly scurry up and out of the hole. You hear curses behind you as you leave – they must have discovered your theft – but no-one follows. They must think that you were here hours ago, not that you are only just leaving!
- *Return to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read, making sure you leave the area quickly!*

## ISHALLPROCEED
You proceed into the passageway and make your way towards the bend.
- *Move your token to Sub-map 4 and follow the directions there*

## ITLLBEFINE
Keeping a careful watch, you proceed forward to the bend.
- *Go to entry DOGLEG*

## JUMPAWAY
Perhaps it was because you were so on edge, but you somehow manage to throw your body to the side just as the ground collapses beneath your feet. However, the pit isn’t that deep, only about three feet...
You scramble out of the grave and back away quickly, brushing the dirt of the grave off yourself in horror.
- *Go to entry RISE*

## JUMPESCAPE
Deduct one spell slot.
Focusing on yourself, you chant the words of the spell and produce the materials from your pouch. You feel your legs change, a strange energy growing inside them. You feel as though you could jump above the forest canopy!
Crouching down, you gather the energy inside you and, like a grasshopper, spring up into the air, well above the edge of the pit. You land easily on the path. Gathering your breath, you feel the energy slowly ebb out of your legs. That was a rush! Too bad you can’t travel everywhere like that!
- *Return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## JUNCTIONTRAPS
Roll perception, DC9.
- *If successful, go to SAFEASHOUSES*
- *If unsuccessful, go to COASTCLEAR*

## KEEPGOING
It is late when you finally reach Weathercote Wood, some 55 miles east of Orlbar. There, on the wood’s edge, you camp and let your horse run free. You won’t be needing him for a while.
Weathercote Wood is thick, the foliage dense, towering walls of green. And in there somewhere, if the information you have is to be trusted, is the boy Darek Brewmont. You settle down in your bedroll, the embers of your fire keeping you warm well into the night. After a full day’s riding it doesn’t take long for you to fall into a deep slumber, the sound of a nearby river lulling you to sleep. You wake just before dawn, fully rested. But a noise instantly puts you on guard; from somewhere nearby comes a wet, slavering sound. Quietly you pick up your weapon and move forward stealthily. When you are some hundred or so feet away, whatever is lurking catches your scent, and you hear it running quickly away. Only dim starlight shows any detail, and all you can see is a darkened shape moving through the night, towards the wood.
- *Do you have a ranged weapon? If so, and you wish to attack using it, go to entry SHOOTAFTER.*
- *If not, go to entry DEADNELLY.*

## KNIGHTATTACK
As he prepares to attack, the Death Knight pauses and smiles at you, a chilling sight to behold. Then, from his bony, decimated gut, a horrid laugh arises, filling the chamber and echoing all around. The air is laced with fear, and Darek Brewmont cowers into a corner, whimpering and covering his face.
Make a wisdom save, DC 13, to see if the Death Knight’s fear aura affects you as well. If you fail the save, you take a -1 penalty to all attack rolls. This effect can be cancelled out by a successful wisdom save, made at the start of each of your turns (except the next one). If you have Grakspores, eat them now! Then, still laughing, he lashes out at you with his longsword!
Roll a d20, adding 5. If the result is higher than your AC, roll damage (1d8+3)
- *Then go to entry TOSSER*

## KNOCKPINS
Your ranged attack hits! Roll damage. If the damage roll is 13 or higher, go to STRIKE. If it is lower than 13, the skeleton flees out of range, disappearing into the woods.
- *Return to tilepage 6 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## KOBOLDBATTLE
Roll 1d8 and place three tokens on the map that many squares from you to represent the kobolds. There are two warriors and what looks like a fire-wielding mage! Attack them in whatever order you see fit. Roll initiative and do battle! For speed of play, it is recommended that you roll once for the Kobold’s initiative (d20+2) and give them all their three attacks on their turn.

### KOBOLDS
Small Humanoid, LE

**Armour Class** 12  
**Hit Points** 5  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**STR** 7 (-2)  
**DEX** 15 (+2)  
**CON** 9 (-1)  
**INT** 8 (-1)  
**WIS** 7 (-2)  
**CHA** 8 (-1)

**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., PP8

**Mage Fireball** +2 to hit, 1d6 fire damage

- *If you are victorious, go to entry DEADLIZARDS*
- *If you are defeated, go to entry OHWELL*

## LEAVECAVE
Mindful of the time, you leave the little alcove, moving quickly, and make to leave the abandoned mine.
Status check: How many things did you do while in the alcove?
- *Did you do any two things from the following list: check the scrolls for clues / try to open the chest / read the strange markings. If you did do two from this list, go to entry DILLYDALLY*
- *If you only did one thing, or if you did none of these things, then you return to the surface. Go to tilepage 8 and continue from the last direction you read*

## LEAVECAVERN
You move back down through the tunnel and out to the river. With your knowledge of the dangerous sections of the river, you are now able to quickly return to the other shore without too much trouble.
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read*

## LEAVECEMETERY
As you turn your back on the crypt and wander back the way you came, you notice the sun in the sky, getting lower. It is barely minutes since you left the junction – isn’t it? It seems time has a mind of its own in Weathercote Wood. You wonder if it is too late for the boy Darek Brewmont? Perhaps he has already been made squire to the ghostly Death Knight, and you are too late! Clouds darken the sky, and a strange feeling enters the pit of your stomach. Your instinct for adventure speaks to you, and you can’t help feeling that your true path lies behind you, within that crypt.
- *If you still wish to leave the cemetery, go to entry EASYPATH*
- *If you decide to turn back and make your way through the cemetery towards the crypt, go to entry SOFTLY*

## LEAVECHAMBER
You climb the stairs leading up from the chamber, back towards the dim light of Weathercote Wood.
Soon you are back outside the great stone double doors that led down to the underground temple.
- *Return to tilepage 3 and continue from the last direction you read.*

## LEAVES
You collect several handfuls of the blood-red leaves. They have a pleasant smell, and with a bit of experimentation could possibly be used to make a tea of some kind… The tea might even be beneficial in some way, there is no way of telling!
Add ‘Red tree leaves’ to your inventory.
- *To cast Detect Magic on the tree, go to MAGICTREE?*
- *To take a branch from the tree, go to TAKEBRANCH*
- *To return to the path, go to REJOINPATH*

## LIKELYCAMP
You can see two potential camp areas, just off the track, one on the northwest corner of the junction and one on the northeast corner. You feel absolutely dog tired, in your bones, and know that if you don’t rest now, the rest of your mission could become increasingly difficult. You need to make camp and try to get some much-earned rest.
- *To make your camp in the northeast corner of the junction, go to NORTHEASTCAMP*
- *To make your camp in the northwest corner, go to CAMPNORTHWEST*
- *To continue, despite your fatigue, return to the tilepage 8 entry and continue from the last direction you read.*

## LITTLEHUT
You approach the little hut that sits to the side of the forest path. It is well made, if a little dilapidated, and covered in vines and creepers.
Cautiously you approach the door, and slowly reach for the handle…
Do you want to check for traps? Roll perception, DC 15
- *If you are successful, go to entry HUTTRAPS*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to entry WELLDAMN*

## LOOKRUBBLE
You move over to the altar and check out the rubble. It becomes obvious quite quickly from looking at these fragments, that a holy idol of some sort once stood here. It has been destroyed.
Wondering what this could mean (or perhaps you already know) you continue to the exit on the far side.
- *Go to entry TUNNELVISION*

## LOOKSFINE
As far as you can see, there is nothing here that looks suspicious.
- *Return to tilepage 7 and continue from the last direction you read*

## LUCKYCRITTERS
You hear a horrid screeching sound. From the undergrowth, two GIANT WOLF SPIDERS appear, hissing ferociously. They move to attack, clicking their pincers menacingly. Your spell has hurt them somewhat, but they still have plenty of fight left!
- *Roll 2d8 and half the result. Go to entry SPIDERBATTLE and commence combat, deducting that number from each spider’s HP.*

## LUCKYDODGE
Just in time you jump out of the way, and the grey beam hits a tree behind you. In horror you turn to see an energy spreading through it, turning it completely to stone, from trunk to branches to leaves. Wasting no more time, you pick yourself up and run for all you’re worth! Behind you, you hear the stranger call, “Oh come on! I didn’t mean it! Come back, talk to me some more.” You keep running, putting as much distance between you and this lunatic as possible!
- *Move to the edge of the tilepage and onto a connecting map immediately!*

## MADEIT
Quickly you work, carving steps efficiently until there are enough footholes that you can climb out. Further up the path, you see a hooded figure come into view. At the site of you, the figure stops in their tracks, throwing their hood back. It is a woman, and she does not look pleased. “Wha – How did you get out?” she exclaims, infuriated at the fact that you have escaped her trap. Without another word, she angrily takes out a crossbow and begins loading a bolt.
- *Go to entry CULTISTCOMBAT*

## MAGICDIVERSION
Focusing, you create the most impressive illusion that you can muster, and prepare to run!
Roll a d20, subtracting one of the modifiers listed below, based on the spell cast:

*Thaumaturgy -5  
Minor Illusion -4  
Silent Image -3  
Prestidigitation -1  
Druideraft No modifier*

- *If the result is lower than your spell save DC, go to entry SMOKEANDMIRRORS*
- *If the result is higher than your spell save DC, go to HISSANDABANG*

## MAGICTREE?
Deduct one spell slot.
You close your eyes and intone the spell, trying to discern the nature of this tree, and if it has any magic potency. After some time, you discern that there is a kind of magic emanating from it… a wild magic. Although it is impossible to discover the exact nature of that magic, you feel that it is definitely benevolent, and very potent too.
- *To take a branch from the tree, go to TAKEBRANCH*
- *To climb the tree, go to TREECLIMB*
- *To return to the path, go to REJOINPATH*

## MASTERTHIEF
You pry the lid of the chest open finally, and look expectantly within...
There is a large amount of semi-precious jewellery and some small art pieces, all of which looks to be worth just under 200gp total value. There is also a large pouch containing what appears to be about 350 gp. But then your eyes fall on it... a purplish bottle, very ornate, with a stopper in the shape of a dragon's head. You lift the lid off and give it a quick sniff, instantly recognizing it as a healing potion, a very potent one at that!
*This is a Potion of Greater Healing.*
You also find a strange set of goggles, which you immediately put on.
*These are Goggles of Night. If you have darkvision, you suddenly notice you can see an extra long distance, 60 extra feet! If you don't, you notice that you now have 60ft darkvision.*

Great finds, all told! You quickly transfer the treasure into your pack, chuckling to yourself at the carelessness of these foolish thieves.
- *To search the pile of books and scrolls for clues, go to SEARCHCLUES*
- *To leave this thieves' lair, go to entry LEAVECAVE*

## MAUSOLEUM
This room is silent, and smells of decay. The four coffins are well kept though, and don’t look especially old. The wood is of a high quality and amongst the musty smell there is also the aroma of lacquer in the air, a sure sign of wealth. Whoever this dead family was, they were not short a gold piece or two. The exit on the far side leads into an open passage that continues and then bends right.
- *To open one of the coffins, go to entry OPENCOFFIN*
- *To proceed to the exit, go to ISHALLPROCEED*

## MCSTEALTH
The mage hand moves in amongst the webs and begins trying to gather the gossamer strands onto its fingers... but no luck. It does not have the power to shift these threads, which are quite strong despite their thinness.
- *Go to entry HEREWEGO*

## MIDNIGHTSNACK
In the very early hours of the morning you awake, feeling well rested (recover 1 hit die immediately) but also experiencing a strange sensation on your neck. You reach up to rub it, and your hand feels something leathery, which moves under your hand!
Your eyes fly open and you realize a bat has appended itself to you, and you have disturbed it during its meal – its meal being you! (deduct 1 piercing damage) The horrible thing screeches as you swat it away, and then flaps into the air and attacks you!

*Place its token within melee range, roll initiative and do battle! Should be quick.*

- *If you are defeated, go to OHWELL*

## MIKADUS
You are at the top, east-west section of the path when you hear something that sounds ridiculously out of place in these ominous woods: singing!

Indeed, you hear someone enthusiastically belting out a joyous song, accompanied by the sounds of rattling, as of a horse laden with goods. You stand still and watch the path ahead.

There, around the corner, comes not a horse, but a pony laden with a multitude of bags, pots, all manner of items. The poor thing looks like it is about to collapse! Walking alongside it is a halfling, a merchant by the looks, in colourful clothes, the source of the jaunty tune. Seeing you, he keeps singing but a wide smile now spreads across his face. As he nears, you see he is accompanied by a smaller creature, a humanoid of some description, the likes of which you have never seen before. Its skin looks like bone.

The merchant finishes his verse just as he comes before you, and he greets you with an elaborate bow, twirling his hand as he bends low.

“Grrrreings, fellow traveller! And salutations on this lovely, balmy evening.” The merchant stands up straight, still grinning.

“Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mikadus Fairweather of Zelbross, and I can’t help thinking destiny has caused us to meet in this beautiful wood!”

Despite the randomness of this encounter, you can’t help but feel pleased to meet a friendly face in this forbidding, gloomy wood.

With a grand, sweeping gesture, Mikadus indicates the wares that his poor beast of burden is laden with.

“And what can I offer such a prosperous traveller as yourself? *Dommiel Get busy!*”

At this hissed command, Mikadus’ assistant, the tawny-coloured humanoid, whose exterior seems to consist of some sort of exoskeleton, starts taking out various wares and parading them before your eyes.

“Provisions, my friend? Useful for those long journeys. I have incense, holy water, healing potions, holy symbols, sheet notation for the musically-minded, all the latest songs from Neverwinter, religious icons…”

The list goes on and on! It seems this Mikadus is a literal travelling market. Nonetheless, despite all the junk that you couldn’t care less for, there are a few things that sound interesting.

The following is a list of items you could purchase from Mikadus:
*Healing Potion (standard) – 50 gp (he has two of these)  
Holy Symbol – 20 gp  
Holy water – 25 gp (one flask)  
Provisions – 5 gp for a week’s worth  
Backpack – 2gp  
Tinderbox – 1 gp  
Rope (50ft) – 1gp  
Torch – 1gp*

- *When you are done with the travelling merchant, go to entry FRIENDLYCHAP*

## MISS
You watch the black shape scurry away, back into the cover of Weathercote Wood, and curse your poor aim. Then you walk forward to where the creature had been before you startled it and sent it running for the trees.
- *Go to entry DEADNELLY*

## MORETRAPS
_Roll perception, DC 18_
- *If you are successful, go to entry PATHDANGER*
- *If you are unsuccessful, go to SEEMSNOT*

## MOSSYLOG
You walk up to the moss-covered log, and as you near it you see that it is covered with fungi, bright green mushrooms. You are not sure if you have seen their kind before. Their colour almost seems phosphorescent, like they would glow even at night!
_Make a survival roll, DC 12._
- *If you succeed, go to FUNKYFUNGI*
- *If you fail, go to MUNGUSFUNGUS*

## MOVEWITHIN
You move further within, down the silent passage, the sound of the river fading behind you. The passage turns to the right and continues for some way. Ahead you can see it opens into a cavern.
- *Go to sub-map 2 and follow the directions there*

## MUNGUSFUNGUS
Try as you might, you can’t seem to recall whether this fungi is poisonous or not. You consider eating a small amount, but have heard stories of very dangerous mushrooms in these parts, and think better of it.
- *Add the green fungi to your inventory if you wish, and then return to tilepage 4 and continue from the last direction you read*

## NASTYBITE
A GIANT CENTIPEDE has dug its pincers into your hand, drawing blood, the ghastly thing!
- *Roll 1d4+2 and subtract the damage from your HP. Then go to entry CENTIBATTLE*

## NASTYTURN
_Roll a d100, adding 10 if you succeeded in an earlier stealth test on this tilepage._
- *If you score 1-25, go to PESKY*
- *If you score 26-50, go to WHATSTHIS*
- *If you score 51 or above go to NOTAWHISPER*

## NEGOTIATE
The Blood Knight’s roar fills the room. “You will accept this quest, or you will die as all mortal flesh dies, on the end of my sword!” He brings his greatsword underneath your chin. You try to move, but you are frozen on the spot, as if by magic. You don’t doubt his words, and you are unarmed. It seems you have little choice.
- *If you still voice your disapproval, go to NOFEAR*
- *If you bow to this intimidating warrior and accept his quest, go to DARKQUEST*
